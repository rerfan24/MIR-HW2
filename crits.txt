One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.

He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people "will" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.
It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.

The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.

I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.

If you like hopeful, surprising, never-seen-before characters, you will enjoy this amusing story of a family of prisoners victimized by the system and a Bible thumping pig.

Robbins and Freeman, and everybody else, gives perfect performances for their characters. Their actions and body languages are perfect for this story and movie.
You have already watched this, right? It is really easy to understand the love for this movie. I'll admit, when it comes to movie adaptations of books, the book is always better. How can it not be? You get way more detail than could be crammed into a two-hour movie. However, I still thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation. Yes, it does deviate from the short a little with character changes and omissions, but I don't think this film could have been any better. I am in line with the ten-star reviews that I'm seeing and the only reason I am not giving this parable for hope a ten myself is because I don't as a rule. Hope, aspiration, fighting the system, justice and humanism against the tyranny of the mainstream society/religion. This is the film.
WHAT. A. MOVIE

It is just so well acted. You believe it all and want more of every single character!

Clever, moralistic and entertaining.

Hollywood has done very few consequential movies since (V For Vendetta, Captain Fantastic and perhaps Watchmen..) so grab this one if you have not watched it.

This is it.

The film has it all. Superb actors, even better screenplay, fabulous redemptive conclusion and believe me when I insist with all of that said they did not forget the entertainment.

Are there/will there ever be any other films like this?
Two imprisoned men (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.

Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.

And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.
This is a great film. It is well constructed, the acting is superb and the characters are so likeable or in the case of the pigs so detestable.
This is the sole film in the world that is over 2 hours and yet I wanted another 2. The story, the acting, the sense of justice, the acting, the triumph of good but not in a linear manner, the acting and certainly the authentic feel of the era make this a justified masterpiece.

Hollywood has lost the ability to make good films nowadays.

Keep churning out the stand up comic Thor, Hollywood.
I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.

It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.

Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.


It is a great piece of film making and a story of hope. Justice is done at the end. I also recommend you watch Female Prisoner Scorpion.


not for a reason. but for the fine art to create a story who seems be more than fiction and who use a script, a cast and location for a puzzle who becomes part of precious memories. its themes, the tension, the moral questions, the meeting between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and the result of dialogs who are truth axis of movie and wise adaptation, are bones of a splendid film. a film who reminds more than presents. values, roots of justice, beauty of original source, the end who is expression of a deep expectation of the viewer are elements who transforms The Shawshank Redemption in an experience for the viewer. short - a film who must see !


It's difficult to review a movie made 25 years ago and say there has been nothing better since, but it is true. The storytelling and the production and the acting and the morality and the good guys and the bad guys and the hope it conveys..., But seeing this in 2021 (again) I have to say the praise is justified.

There is just something about Shawshank Redemption.

Want to know something amazing? Look at the director's credits. Not into cashing in, is he?
"The Shawshank Redemption" should have won Best Picture for 1994. A story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) getting falsely convicted of murder and sent to the hellish Shawshank prison, the movie is beyond amazing. In prison, Andy meets Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who was imprisoned many years earlier. Red gets Andy a poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the next twenty years, Andy experiences all the horrors that one would expect in jail: beatings by the guards, rapes by other inmates, and so on. But he never gives up hope.

This movie, like "Carrie", "The Shining", "Dolores Claiborne", "The Green Mile" and "Hearts in Atlantis", just goes to show what a great author Stephen King is. When we think of horror, we think of spooky horror, but "The Shawshank Redemption" is a different kind: personal horror. Pure genius. I can only hope that in the coming years, this movie is recognized as what it is: a masterpiece. I can't believe that it won no Oscars!
I cannot think of one reason I would not give this 10/10 just out of principle. Otherwise, it is the perfect movie with an incredible story, acting and euphoric finale that nonetheless is not without tragedy in the meantime.

I need to find the original story.
That you want a sequel.

I didn't want it to end and I never say that. This is the first one where I said, 'More Please.'

The acting, screenplay, lesson it imparts and ending are perfect.

Ignore my review however. Go watch a bunch of remakes and gender switches, franchise boys.

Six Palestinian heroes escaped from Israeli jail through tunnel today Monday 09-07

They are the real heroes.


I am not black, not a crook, not a prisoner, not a Christian retarded warden and not from that period and yet i identify with these guys, their plight and their times.

The story is entertaining, the characters interesting and the plot development anticipatory and fascinating.

Makes me forget for 2 hours that I live in a period of remakes, sequels, gender switches, DCU, MCU and... GAG.

This is Tim Robbins best performance ever. It is a compelling heart warming drama about an innocent man(Andy Dufresbe) who is sent to prison and learns to use his intelligence to make the best of prison life. He meets a mentor in Red(Morgan Freeman) and they build a friendship that is stronger than the walls that surround them. Andy steadies a relationship with the warden that keeps him in the good eyes of the prison. Andy is full of surprises and uses his resourcefulness to not only win the friendships of his fellow prisoners, but also of the prison guards. Both Andy and Red both hold on to their dream of one day enjoying their freedom. They turn their friendship and dreams of freedom into a bond that no prison could ever take away.
The Shawshank Redemption has great performances, extremely well written script and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax! One of the best dramas of all time!

The best movie in history and the best ending in any entertainment business


It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous. There's no posturing. Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyone's lips. Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into. Finals if he so exhilarating you a high-quality music. And finding that deserves really deserve. I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way. This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars. Will remain as the best film in more than 10 years, I believe wholeheartedly sites. Definitely one of the best films in the world.

The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. I watched this movie for the umpteenth time. A movie I would never ever get bored of. Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption. Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison. The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I have heard. Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith. The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest film. It has everything you could possibly want in a movie. If you don't love Shawshank, chances are you are beyond redemption. It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece. It's in my top five movies of all time. I feel so bad about not writing a review of this masterpiece during the late nineties.
Whilst the IMDb users may disagree, the Shawshank Redemption isn't my number 1, maybe not even my top 100. But with that said, I have seen this movie a few hundred times and it gets wary. There is no doubt it is good, I may even say it's close to great and it has a pretty good watchability rating, but it's forced metaphors get on my nerves now and, in reality, is just another prison movie which is above average.

Boring if you have seen it a few times, but for a first impression it is good. Once you start to analyze its elements you can begin to see the film for what it is. A perfect film it is not, but the acting is near perfect and the realism is somewhat accurate. Not my favorite film, not my favorite prison film, but give it a whirl and see how you decide.



The emotions, the plot, originality, everything tied together so well at the end - normally I criticise the way movies end, but this ending was phenomenal, not cliche at all. The brutality of the prison was well portrayed, and made me feel sorry for the characters.

All the characters were believable and had depth, and none of the scenes were dramatic, but there was tension throughout the film. I'm going to stop fangirling now, but this movie is my favourite tied with the Godfather!!
'The Shawshank Redemption' is the best film ever made in the history of world cinema! The Best Hollywood Film Of All-Time! A Masterpiece! A cult classic! A legendary Epic! A Film that you moves you, leaves you stunned!

Performances: Tim Robbins is astounding, his careers finest after Mystic River. Morgan Freeman is masterful, his careers finest after Million Dollar Baby. Others are excellent.

'The Shawshank Redemption' is cinema at its very best. My salute to this flick! A true Masterpiece! I just love this film! The most powerful film of all-time.
I enjoyed reading Stephen King's short story "Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption" from the book "Different Seasons" more than watching the movie. However, it's still one of my favourite movies of all time.

It has very few peers, and has to be seen. It is Awesome.
There is no denying that this is a very good movie. The acting is great and it tells a good story.

Personally, I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste, but its far from a bad film.

On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.

This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie, not because its a great one.


Quite deserving of such acclaim, the acting is superb, the storyline captivating, and the cinematography quite beautiful. The storyline itself was unexpected and I quite enjoyed watching it unfold. Tim Robbins is really incredible in that his character comes off so subtly. And let's be honest, how can any movie narrated by Morgan freeman be bad?

A good prison movie whose cult of fans has made it into something so much more than it is. Greatest movie ever made? Get real. It's not even the greatest prison movie ever made. Hell, it's not even the best movie released in 1994! It's predictable and borrows heavily from decades of prison movie clichés. It's also nowhere near as deep as its staunchest admirers would have you believe. Still, it's an entertaining movie. Nice direction from Frank Darabont. Morgan Freeman is the highlight with a solid supporting cast. Tim Robbins, however, is borderline ridiculous at times with his cartoonish facial expressions and silly "stares-off-into-the-distance" moments. He's so far beneath Freeman as an actor it's sad. With a normal movie like this, I would focus more on the positives. I did give it a 7, after all. Unfortunately, it is easily the most overrated movie of all time (on IMDb, for sure) and as such the balance of positive to negative is out of whack.
THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994) **** Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton,Clancy Brown, William Sadler, James Whitmore, Gil Bellows. Excellent adaptation of Stephen King's novella "Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption" with falsely accused of murdering his wife Robbins facing hard time in a corrupt prison and a solid friend (Freeman in an unforgettable Oscar-nominated performance of stoicism). Great acting and above the preconceived "prison film" genre that also breaks away from the cliché of the human spirit yet enables its elements. Nominated for several Oscars including Best Picture, Screenplay Adaptation and Director.
At the time of writing this comment, IMDb ranks the Shawshank Redemption as No. 2 in top 250 best movies of all time. Let me tell you that this is no exaggeration and no small feat given IMDb's strict rating criteria. Shawshank is indeed, up there amongst the best, and if you haven't seen it yet, you should make it a point to watch it, at least once sometime in your life. For it is an astonishing tale, of endurance, courage, life, and perspective, combined with a stunning score that flows so closely with the highs and lows of emotion that it could make grown men cry. No words can explain how good Shawshank really is, but let the sheer volume of good user reviews made by devotees in this website be proof enough of its greatness.

I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes.
I have written a few reviews on IMDb and Shawshank is one of my favorite movies of all time. I don't necessarily think this movie was a 10 but an easy 9 for me. I am giving it a 10 because of the negative reviews that I read with saying they gave this movie a 1 just because others had given it a 10. As far I'm concerned it's mine to give, if I want to to give every a movie a 10, (which by the way I don't). I am just sick of people telling me that a movie can't be great because it was story driven and not character driven, maybe I like story driven movies, I certainly liked this one. So here's another 10 for you movie snobs will have to eradicate.
This is indeed one of the best prison dramas I've ever seen. I've always been a fan of Tim Robbins and he doesn't let me down here. But I can't believe this is so high in the overall list (I would place it in the 150-200 range myself). Even if we just stick with Tim Robbins, 'The Player', 'Short Cuts' and 'Jacob's Ladder' are all far better films. It was the ending of the film that really disappointed me, but since I'm not allowed to talk about endings in these reviews I can't explain why! Suffice it to say that I can imagine at least two fairly obvious endings that would have been better. Maybe it's the 'American Factor', what with me being English, but the overrating of this film completely baffles me.

Movies which are better than their source novella!

Imagine that!

I admit I went and read the story after the first or second time I watched this movie, but I enjoyed it regardless. This film is a movie of hope and friendship and remaining alive even if the tunnel seems never-ending.

Well done all around.
Don't want to say any words about this film. Just a perfect 10.
An interesting movie with good performances. It's basically about hope and hold it together. It is the final outcome that matters the most.

Is about 2 imprisoned men who bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency. Robbins, Freeman and the supporting cast is good enough.

I don't think it is worthy to be the #1 movie in the IMDb though. That's just not possible.

I know that "debate" started between TSR and TDK.

Anyway a good overall movie. especially if you are into prison dramas, then this movie is for you.
This Is Such A Classic And One Of My Favorite Movies Always Loved Watching This Movie
I totally adored the concept of hope in this film. I love how the director portrays the Shawshank tyrants as corrupt murderers, that's pretty much what they are and serve as the grounds for the escape of Andy. Now Morgan Freeman's got talent, I love that guy he may not be the greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the set. I loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of characters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of Shawshank. You know there's a lot more to say about this movie, it's too good too be true. Especially the ending which by the way brought tears to eyes, the most moving scene!!! Overall it was superb and all thanks to Stephen King for putting this in the form of alphabets in the first place. I'm starting to regret not reading any of his novels. And kudos to the director for even coming up with such an idea for a movie.
I liked this film. That sums it up pretty well. This film is good, in some aspects very good, but the best film of all time? I usually don't say this, but I think The Shawshank Redemption is overrated. I don't want to take away from the performances, the story or the score, those were really good. I guess Opinions differ and that's fine. For me personally the fact that I knew that this film was "the highest rated film of all time" unfortunately hurt my experience. I was expecting a lot more, which in the end I didn't get. But still a good watch nonetheless.
There's a reason this is rated the #1 . It is the same reason you simply watch this movie every time you see it on tv even if it's already half way over. It's captivating, brilliant and full of heart.
It deserves ten stars. Its beauty lies in its slow pace and genteel wit, although some may not have the patience for the slowness. But the whole premise of life inside a prison cell makes better sense when told in a calm, emotion-building, pace such as this. Otherwise, one would never get to know Tim Robbins's quiet accountant (and what makes him appear alternately shy, snobbish, and suicidal all at the same time); or Morgan Freeman's genial-but-cynical lifer- not to mention how he's "a man who knows how to get things." I love what the film doesn't do: it doesn't make an issue of its two leads being different races (although one could claim that makes their friendship all the more marvelous), it doesn't pull any sensational, far-out, action punches (as films with an all-male cast often do), and it doesn't freeze its characters into types. Everyone is real and everyone is flawed- from James Whitmore's bird loving veteran to Bob Gunton's pretentious, icy, warden. But the finish (which really starts around the film's last twenty minutes) is one of the most powerful and moving things ever committed to film. Get it in either format.

Its not that amazing neither is it bad its just idk that cousin at the family reuinion that nobody cares about and they just stand their to make it look more crowded even though there not needed this film is not needed and the movie is just there.

The first time I ever saw this movie I was just floored at how incredible it was. What wonderful casting that was done to help this amazing story be told. Stephen King has a way about creating such memorable characters. For those of you who think this movie is a "prison movie" you are sadly mistaken. This movie merely takes place in a prison but this story is about so much more...friendship, hope, survival and dreams! There is a reason this movie is voted #1 on the IMDb site! Not only have I enjoyed watching this movie over a hundred times but I have been lucky enough to have been in that prison numerous times doing paranormal events. My last visit out there was last weekend and I decided to also go and visit all of the filming locations! That was a real treat! All I can say is that if you have not seen this film just take the time to watch it and just take in the amazing story and the incredible performances turned in by the cast! I promise you that you won't be sorry!!!
Decent entertainment, somewhat memorable. Why this is seen as such an incredible, sensational work of art is beyond me... I feel like this is one of the few crime-thriller-prison-action related films that met my expectations, as in, was A Good Film, but that alone doesn't make it a classic.
I first saw this film, like many others, by chance and on DVD. And like others, I have since watched it over and over again. When I feel sad, it makes me feel happy, when I need hope, it gives me hope.When I want to reaffirm my very belief in life, and all it can offer, this film gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close to doing.It soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself. The portrayal of friendship, the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope. Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great. The cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls. Thank you Mr Darabont, Mr Robins and Mr Freeman. Thank you to every one else involved. You changed my life

This film will stand the test of time And it will remain one of the best films ever made

Please do not remake this gem It must be left alone..

Superb

i watch this movie for minimum 5-6 times first to last. so every time i enjoyed as i watching it first time. its a piece of art. and we now know how to entertain with no action or fighting scenes. its a pure drama that anyone can enjoy with family in silence. so i rate this movie 10 out of 10 because of amazing screen play, acting, casting, background scoring editing etc. this is my first movie review so pardon me if i did any mistake.
One of the best movies ever made. Simple as that. Top 20 ever, and top 3 of the 90s. The ending is just so powerful.
A film about a Stephen King story? Directed by Frank Darabont. . . Who? Starring Tim Robbins. . . Wasn't he the guy from Howard the Duck? I admit, only the sublime acting talents of Morgan Freeman took me along to see this movie. Now the only questions I have to ask are: Why didn't EVERYBODY go to see this movie? and, Why didn't Morgan Freeman win the Oscar? Tom Hanks is a fine actor but, he should never have beaten Morgan. Once again a Stephen King short story translates to film better than his horror opus'. Tim Robbins pulls out his finest performance to date, and, Mr Darabont take a bow. Very rarely are you left with a large smile and warm heart at the end of a movie but, I could have danced as the camera slowly panned back from the beach. . . Perfect.

You could describe "The Shawshank Redemption" in a number of ways; engrossing drama, riveting character study, top-shelf prison movie. But it's nothing it not a shining example of the power of the indomitable human spirit. You root for Andy Dufresne from the very beginning as a man unfairly targeted by fate, and you want desperately for him to succeed . . . somehow. Mixed in with all of this is a well-written story about friendship, and even a little bit of revenge to sweeten the deal. As a Stephen King story, it's a classic, and a faithful screen adaptation.

And that cast is impeccable.

9/10
a film about freedom. not only because the story has as scene a prison. but for the force and grace and precise of creation freedom of actors and director, ideas and dialogs, whole script and special emotions of viewer. it is a rare film because it represents more than brilliant acting or smart script. it is a homage for basic values and eulogy to friendship. it is representation of a form of revolution who can be considered fruit of a different religious perception. it seems be perfect. and this is key to be more than a good/interesting film but an extraordinary cinema lesson. Red, Rita Hayworth poster and Andy Dufresne. that is all. at first sigh.
So worth seeing in the theater thanks to fathom events and 25th anniversary plus Stephen King turned 72 recently! I admit I've been on the fence about enjoying Shawshank Redemption for a while but seeing it in the theater and re watching after not seeing it for a long time, I cried, I laughed, felt sympathy, and was very immersed.

Truly remarkable and well deserving of every good opinion even after I was on the fence about it, I love the movie a lot now; Tim Robbins embodied such a glorious character! Frank Darabont made such a crafty, dark and heart wrenching experience! Fathom events is excellent, I am glad I paid over $13 dollars to see such drama perfected film.

Truly a masterpiece of cinema. I hope this film gets the critical recognition it deserves as the years go by. Almost everyone i have encountered has loved this film. How did it not win oscars galore. Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman are simply perfect in what is essentially a love story. A love of hope, a love of friendship and a love of life, no matter the constraints. I LOVE THIS FILM!
This film is probably the best life-in-prison film ever made. It depicts one man's time in the big house for something he (supposedly) didn't do. This man is Andy Dusfresne (pronounced Duframe) played in his best ever, Tim Robbins. But he isn't alone; he is joined by fellow inmate (who is the only guilty person in Shawshank) Red played also very well by Morgan Freeman. Freeman narrates the life in The Shawshank prison all the way up until the end (not to mention some very memorable escape scenes). Very memorable, showing what movies are made of. Based on Stephen King's novel (one of his best) and adapted for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont, who 5 years later would write and direct the Green Mile, another good (but can't be matched to this one) prison movie. A++
When i watched this film i thought now whats this going to be like? After watching it i thought it was a brilliant film,fantastically acted with greats like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton. Very realistic and definitely one of my absolute favourites of all time. At the end it made me cry and thought about life. Every time i watch it the film brings a tear to my eye. Fantastic film and worth watching,it's really realistic film and another one of stephen king's great stories, a story of hope and many people who have watched will say the same thing - if you haven't seen this film already then watch it, it is brilliant, just brilliant!!

be prepared to be moved, it's such a breathtaking journey for the whole two hours. A truly lovely magical film, my favourite of all time fantastic

Since I bought (a lot of years ago) a videotape with two Stephen King's short films, one of them "The Woman In The Room", directed by Frank Darabont, I had the strange sensation that this guy could very well become one of the good directors in the filming industry... and here we are, with another King's story he managed to do one of the best films in this decade (90's), of course, with the help of nonetheless but mr. Freeman and mr. Robbins, who could have spoiled it?
This movie is intelligent, based on an excellent book played by legendary actor as Morgan Freeman. Directed by a true artist ( Frank Darabont), I hope that this movie will be remembered for many and many years, Probably the best Picture ever made in the all history. You need to see at least one time in your life.
Great movie still holds up well today. Cinematography top notch, acting amazing from whole cast, directing on point, casting fantastic. Couldn't ask for anything better.




Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a well educated banker, is wrongfully convicted of killing his wife and her lover and sentenced to life in prison at Shawshank Penitentiary. This movie follows his life as it falls apart and he succumbs to living as an inmate surrounded by hardened criminals and a strict bible thumping warden with his henchmen prison guards.

Saw this movie years ago and was absolutely stunned. This film is a genuine masterpiece and probably the greatest movie ever made. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are amazing and just steal the show as convicts turned best friends. The movie is perfectly paced with very real characters and emotions that are all captivating. The prison itself is very authentic and the set pieces are very realistic which captured the prison environment better than any other prison set film except for maybe Escape From Alcatraz. Even as a hard drama this movie is never slow or boring or dry it is simply just that good.
What to say about the "Shawshank Redemption"? I shouldn't really have to say anything because when most people hear about it, they already have a pretty good idea of how incredible it is. This movie is freakin' immaculate. Darabont and Co. have created not only the most inspiring film in ages, but one of the most emotionally significant films to date. The movie teaches things to us that we need to know - messages on hope, perseverance, and friendship - and it does it with marvelous eloquency. All in all, "The Shawshank Redemption" remains one of the most spectacular films I have ever seen - a master piece of art. Perfect.
I have never watched a better movie than this before
When i rented the movie, i was doubtful, whether to rent it or not. Then i started watching it. From the very 1st moment i was kinda sure, it wud be worthy watching this; and worthy it was. The fascinating performance of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, the direction, and everything puts you in the place of the actors, making you feel the way they felt. This movie doesn't have any dirty romance or impossible actions, rather, it focuses on a greater philosophy - Hope to live when there is no hope, survival -- This is one movie, that will leave you talking about it even many days after watching. I won't say anymore, the rest is up-to you to find out when you see the movie
I have long viewed the Shawshank Redemption as the most underrated film of all time. That isn't to say that it wasn't universally acknowledged by the movie-going public as a great movie, but in terms of awards, critical acclaim, and best ever lists, this has somehow kept on losing out. Now that I see it has the number two position, as voted by the movie-going public, on probably the most accurate best ever list in the world (AFI be damned), I am eminently pleased. There is no way Forrest Gump should have won best picture over Shawshank. Certainly, Forrest Gump is a charming, well-acted film, but it is nothing compared to this. Morgan Freeman excels, and Tim Robbins turns in his best performance. If you haven't seen this masterpiece, get up and rent it immediately.
This film is easily in my top three favorite films. I return to it time and time again, still captivated! Bravo to everyone involved in this timeless production.
An overrated film that I watched as a teenager and recently decided to re-watch. I must say right away that I like this film, but it is undeservedly and too popular and occupies the first line - this is completely undeserved in comparison with other films of more talented authors. I am very saddened that people do not see other works, and for so long this film has been number one among the best films. The actors are talented, the plot is just good, not brilliant, like Stanley Kubrick in "A Space Odyssey". Even this I am ready to see in the top-1, but not "Shawshank Redemption". I understand that many will disagree with me or say that I just hate, but this is not true, and you can understand this by comparing it with other films, is this film so good and does it deserve the first place?
Great music, superb actors. It is a pity that Forrest Gump (which I consider another masterpiece ) went out the same year and got all the publicity, as well as the Oscars. It was not fair.

The only reason for which I rented this movie, two years ago, was because of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. But it was a big surprise to see one of the best films ever made. ( I have seen it 6 more times since then )

It is a story of COURAGE, PERSEVERANCE, TRUE FRIENDSHIP, HOPE AND REDEMPTION.

IT'S A MOVIE FOR ALL TIMES, A MEMORABLE ONE. EVERYBODY SHOULD SEE IT. YOÚ WON'T REGRET.
Satisfying, good movie, but the only great part of this movie is the magnificent performance by Morgan Freeman. An apparently inspired Tim Robbins rises above his very mediocre talent and delivers an adequate performance. Ham-handed attempts at profundity in every scene get tiring as is the use of every prison movie device, character, and cliche in the history of hollywood.
this film is an award winning achievement i loved it what a fantastic and brilliant together drama and crime movie really really amazing a must see to everyone.the story is about a guy called Andy Dufresne who was sent to prison for a murder that was committed to his wife and Andy goes through prison with hard times and a friend for his time in the shaw shank prison with brilliant ac tining from Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman and Clancy brown throughout the film Tim Robbins was Andy Morgan freeman red and Clancy brown as the guard.overall the whole truth can not be told u will love this film don't spoil this for your self its a brilliant story with friendship and survival 10/10 you must get this on DVD trust me its brilliant

The Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you can watch over and over, catching different nuances each time and bringing your own life experiences each time you watch it. Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman should have won an Oscar (a shame he had to wait for Million Dollar Baby.) There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is any drawback to this movie, it is that it is a shade too long, meaning it's often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV. Rent this, or better yet, buy it to get the full thrust of it. Definitely on my personal top 10.
I was reluctant to see this movie - thought it was just another prison movie - and I was certainly tired of mindless violence. I was channel surfing one evening - and stumbled across this movie. I watched a few minutes, thinking I would change channels at the first commercial. Almost 2 hours later - after seeing the end - I sat there...saying "Wow". That was a great movie. I have since recommended it to friends and family...it has grown in popularity due to word of mouth - and certainly deserves its spot at the top. Morgan Freeman put on a masterful performance, as did Tim Robbins. The way their friendship develops and the interplay with the other inmates - a wonderful story.

If you have not watched this movie yet - put preconceived notions aside, sit down, and enjoy the journey!
Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who is sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan Freeman's Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen King's short story "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption" (in the film version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the ultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few homosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole. However, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well served by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out amazing, three-dimensional characterizations. The finale is pure fantasy, however it does provide the audience with the release it needs, and Robbins and Freeman are excellent. Long, involved, but engrossing and satisfying, "Shawshank" was not a big hit at the box-office but found a devoted following on video and cable. **1/2 from ****
The classic can be recalled repeatedly. Andy is full of yearning for life and freedom. To get out of prison is a new life for him; and red, who has been used to prison life, has become numb. To get out of prison is death for him.
I remember when i first saw this film. my friend kept telling me to watch it as he thought it was brilliant. well, all good things come to those who wait yes? i did something I had never done before or since: when i finished watching it i rewound it and watched it again straight after.It has a perfect cast, story and the best ending of any film i have ever seen.To sum up in one word: magical!
My top film. Hope is good, and it never dies. 🌲🌲🌲
This movie is absurdly overrated by people who think soppy affirmative moviemaking accompanied by a lush score is synonymous with aesthetic brilliance.

The direction is nothing to write home about, the cinematography is, frankly, standard. The script has Steven King written all over it - a melodramatic plot involving the woes of an educated bloke told in overwrought dialogue full of clumsy metaphors. (A good example: the moment when the scriptwriter decided that the prisoner's interest in geology had to be spelled out for the dumber members of the audience "It's all about TIME and PRESSURE..." just in case anyone managed to miss the connection). Morgan Freeman is, as usual, superb but Tim Robbins is inconsistent as a man who goes from being the gaol newcomer to an old hand. While the film's sympathetic liberal political stance can be commended, it's certainly not a great work of art.
A very, very, very brilliant film. The acting is superb from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, as always. The script was amazing, along with the directing. The film is one of the best films ever made due to how original it is. And the reason it is original is because it is a prison film with heart. It makes you care about criminals. The score is also very good.

It's an enthralling piece of cinema and just... Amazing. I'd recommend this film to anyone due to everyone relating to it. People like films were you are sympathetic towards a criminal, just look at A Clockwork Orange.
The acting is adequate, the story is adequate, but why all the fuss?

It sometimes baffles me why some movies get such high ratings when they are really only run of the mill.

This is not that bad a film, just seen it all before.
I think that the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made. The acting is crisp and full of endless tension, sometimes forlorn and on other occasions full of fear. How Stephen King could come up with a horror story like this is beyond me. It's a real nightmare to be in a penal system with so many things going against you. Personally, I think that Forrest Gump (FG) is also a tale of Hope, but in a different sense. Firstly, FG shows the hope of waiting for the woman you love for over 20 years. Secondly, FG shows that there can be hope for mentally disabled people to continue in society and aim for goals. I think that both movies are great and should not be missed or inappropiately criticised. I also urge people to watch La Vita e bella (Life is beautiful) as it is as good as The Shawshank Redemption and has some similar points. May we all hope for more movies like these.

PS Also watch It's a Wonderful Life (James Stewart) as this is about hope as well.
I really loved this movie I watch 2 time actually but it was too long
Not only is this film one of the most touching I have ever seen, it also has one of the most unexpected and inspiring endings I have ever seen. The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I've heard

Now, I see what everybody was talking about. It took me 4 years to see this, in my opinion, masterpiece. If you have not seen this movie rent it anyway you can. The performances delivered by Robbins and Freeman are, to me, the pinnacle of both their careers. This film cannot help but evoke tactile imagery to the fullest capacity. You feel what the main characters are going through the sensation is uncanny. Robbins (Andy) and Freeman ("Red") are a balance of the human spirit. Andy is your freedom-seeking hope side and "Red" is your rational, pessimistic counterpart. Find your equilibrium in "The Shawshank Redemption."
An excellent movie that can surely move you a bit. It throws open the question that can we really have prisons which are redemption centers in the true sense. At the same time, it redefines the word criminal. Are the heinous acts committed by administrative authorities justifiable by any means. There should be a code of conduct for the authorities and a HOLY PRISON MAINTENANCE BIBLE if any reformation has to take place. The movie goes through several touching incidents and may bore you a bit if you rarely sees serious touching movies and are fans of slick sci-fi thrillers moving at extraordinary pace like Matrix etc. However the exceptional acting by lead stars particularly by Morgan Freeman and the picking up of the tempo in the second half will leave you gasping for more. After Citizen Kane, Casablanca & Godfather, it is another classic that will stay in the echelons of the movie rating lists for long. There are a few weak points though. There was insufficient attention given to some characters and movie portrays just one side of the whole story not remaining fair to the prison authorities. And finally if it was told in a non-linear tale then it would have been much more interesting
WEll I had high hopes for this movie. But it fell way short. I was hoping it would keep me guessing, but this movie was easy to predict what was going to happen. Though I did think the acting was good by both main stars.

The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that turned out to be good .. or in, this case, brilliant.

Although the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the 1950's, I can easily imagine it being transferred to today's time and standards. The thing that is most fascinating about is is that the directors [and writers, of course] didn't use extreme clichés - there's no black and white painting, just numerous shades of grey. Robbins and Freeman both are perfect for their roles, as are all of the supporting actors.

Finally, I can understand why a certain movies gets a high ranking.
This is the best movie I ever watched in my entire life.whenerver I feel sad or depressed I always watch this movie.it always gives me hope.Hope is a good thing.

This for me and many other people is the greatest movie of all time it has amazing directing it has amazing acting by Tim Robinson and Morgan freeman whoever says that they don't like this movie should never watch another movie again overall the greatest movie of all time.
With universal themes such as redemption, friendship, and good-defeats-evil tale, and without any significant technical flaws, it may be difficult to dislike Shawshank Redemption, one of well-done Hollywood flicks in the 90s by invisible employee directors, while it may also be difficult to find it compelling, imaginative, and inspirational. Despite a prison situation Tim Robbins keeps looking ridiculously gorgeous all the time, but this is made-in-Hollywood.

For it's subtlety, it's intelligence, and it's gorgeous cinematography (often overlooked in this film), this is one of the finest films ever made. Robbins and Freeman are brilliant. The rest of the cast flows through the storyline with a poise and cadence that is flawless. The story itself is based on a short work by Stephen King, but the screenplay is sculpted perfectly and gently into a full-length film by Frank Darabont. A powerful story of one man's journey through a punishment he did not deserve, and "redemption" of soul that lifts the hearts of viewers. It reminds us that "hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things". Gentle and supremely smart.
Tye movie is just perfect. The acting the story the characters are just so good that they will even make you cry
Nice title :) 10/10 best one i have seen my dude couldn't get any better
This movie surprised me so much I watched it twice in one day the first time I saw it. Sure I hadn't just picked a movie at random, at the local DVD-shop, but I didn't expect it to be so good. After I watched it I had a look on the IMDb website and was surprised once again that i found it placed number 2 on the top 250 movies list. I wondered to myself, why didn't I know about this movie. Afterall Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are quite well-known actors. Frank Darabont however only just caught my attention in 1999, when 'the Green Mile' was released. Finally I came to the conclusion that it must have been either television, because it surely isn't on television often enough, or it could just be me, not knowing very much about the film-world before 1995. For in fact, everyone in my school seemed to have known 'the Shawshank Redemption' for a very long time. "One of the best movies ever", my best friend said, "My favorite movie in the whole wide world", another one of my friends. THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME!!!! I replied. If you liked 'the Green Mile', I'm telling you now, you'll love this!!!
The first time I saw this film I said those three words a lot to my friends and family. Shawshank Redemption is the BEST FILM I have ever seen in my lifetime. I have seen tons of films. Morgan Freeman gave a performance that will touch anyone's heart. From beginning to end this film shows how films should be made.
A film directed by Frank Darabont. Starring Tim Robbins. At first I was retissant but when I knew that in this film there was this sublime actor who is Morgan Freeman. Anyone who spends time watching TV and watching movies should have seen this movie at least once in their lives. It is a great sadness for me to learn that Morgan Freeman did not win the Oscar for this film.
This is definitely one of my favorite movies -- it makes me cry and laugh and ache inside all at once. Tim Robbins, you make my days a little brighter -- thank you!
It's a legendary film - If you don't like it, you're wrong! Great story, acting, and suspense. I've seen it like 20 times.

This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. I first read the book, and I didn't liked it that much, but then I saw the movie. And that's a things that's never happened to me before, the movie was better than the book. It's the other way normally. But in this case, the movie is so much better, I like the end more than in the book. Watch the movie, it is great.
Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film I have ever seen. It is the only movie I've seen that has made tears of happiness come to my eyes. I would (and do) recommend this film to anyone and everyone.
The characters are so well developped and well interpreted by the actors that you really feel for them which makes the whole story even more compeling. The structure builts up emotionnaly like only Darabont can do it. Breathtaking!

Fantastic movie. One of the best 90s movies I've seen.

Everything about this movie from plot to character development is solid. The ending wraps the story up in a meaningful and memorable way. There is a reason why this movie continues to be referenced time and time again.
By far Shawshank was the best film of 1994. But look who it was up against at the Oscars...Forrest Gump. It's not that Forrest Gump was such a horrible movie as alot of people make it out to be, in fact it was good. But it was also a very hyped movie. The public ate it up, and they also got too much of it. That might be the reason everybody on the internet seems to hate it so. But to say Forrest Gump is better than the Shawshank Redemtion is a far cry. I wish the Oscar's didn't do this all the time. They vote on who they think the public wants to win it seems like sometimes. It was robbed. But that doesn't make it any less of a film. It's a triumph of filmmaking. Robbins and Freeman are excellent. The character Brooks is terrific, and the warden is protrayed perfectly by Bob Gunton. Go rent this movie, if it's the last thing you do. The ending is one of the most satisfying in movie history.
I had been meaning to see this film since it is rated #1 on IMDb. It is a very good film and very well acted; however, no wayyyyyy is it the best film of all time. Morgan Freeman is particularly good as Red and the other actors perform very admirably, but I don't find the film overwhelmingly powerful. I've seen many many films that do more. I rate it a 7 out of 10.
This is not just a movie. I cant explain it. A truly masterpiece, which tells the lesson that hope never ever dies, live your life
I am bowled over by this movie. This is simply the best movie ever made. The story just leaves you moved and the performances in the movie are clearly the best performances ever on screen. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman enact their roles to perfection, they don't miss out even a dot in fulfilling the roles to excellency.

I cant believe i waited so long before i actually watched this movie, i should have watched it before, and then over and over again.

Don't be scared to watch this movie, you will be amazed by this masterpiece. I cant stop raving, I say WATCH IT NOW! 10 on 10 isn't enough!

I like to keep things short and sweet.
Incredible, unforgettable, three-demential characters that develop over the course of the film
Amazing story with tons of twists and turns you will never see coming
One of the best endings in film
Acting is outstanding
Great foreshadowing
Perfect runtime
I would say to stop reading this review and just watch it already but let's face it, you already have.
This film is perfect in every sense of the word. The second the movie starts it grabs you and holds your attention for the rest of the film. It is never boring. All of the hints that lead to the finale is absolutely genius, and the attention to detail is perfect. The third act is the best of all time. Roger Deakins gives one of his more subtle works, and it plays out beautifully. The dialogue is perfect, and you deeply care about the characters.
This movie is annoying in several ways. The criminals are all goodhearted, thoughtful, sensitive guys while the guards and warden are the REAL bad guys. gimme a break. What is this? Dukes of Hazard? (which was far better than this). Further, the plot is so, so, so predicable. Good guy outsmarts the bad guys and real justice is served. spare me. I know, a lot of people love this flick, but in my humble opinion it is a big waste of time.
In my opinion this is the one movie that is absolutely the greatest the first time you watch it. It's probably my favorite movie. It may not have the replay value of some of my other favorites but, the first time you watch it when you don't know what is about to happen, is the probably the greatest thing you can experience in terms of movies. I only wish could I forget it so I could watch it again for the first time. As a matter of fact if I ever suffered complete amnesia there would be at least one definite benefit. I am not going to talk about the ending and for god's sake if anybody puts a spoiler warning on their comments do not read them!
''The Shawshank Redemption'' is one of the best movies I have ever watched in my life. Tim Robbins is really a good actor and thanks to him this movie is such a success. Also Morgan Freeman is really brought me the story. The story is excellent,the time has just flew with this movie. This movie just gets better with every showing. There's no some special effects and that is just great-just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. Everyone must watch this movie.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.
This movie I'm not going to call this film the IMDb #1 movie, but I really can't deny that this is fantastic. The cast, the score, the writing, and the power are all here in this film, and filled with strength. It's one of those movies that you will continue to think about even after the film is over. It is about a friendship, a life, an evil, and a hope. A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls. We see these people as years of time goes by. We see friendships grow, and topics change. It really puts you in the prison, and makes you feel what's like to behind those bars. You feel the friendship, the hope, the darkness, and the pure horror of it all.

4 stars out of 4
Like I did a few years back, you might be hesitating about watching this film. The title didn't appeal to me, and neither did the subject matter, so it was only by chance that I started to watch it.

I can only say that the film was a revelation for me and has stayed with me ever since. There are so many dark and hopeless films out there which, whilst they leave an impression, leave the wrong one i.e that there is no hope in life. Watch this film and be uplifted and be encouraged by the message...that there is ALWAYS hope....in any situation.

Please watch this film and the watch it again. It's a great answer to all the cynicism that is out there.
This is just a typical prison yarn with some mawkish sentiment

tossed in. I really don' t understand the fuss. I guess some people

look for grandeur and prjoect it onto middling, palatable material

like this. That's the only explanation I've got for the unwarranted

popularity of this flick. Production credits are fine enough, as is the

acting but it certainly doesn't belong on any repsectable list of

greatest films of all time.
The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It is truly one of the most fulfilling movies ever made. There are so many good things about it that it is hard to even come close to mentioning all of them, so I'll only mention the one thing I liked the most. I liked the fact that the movie could have ended a couple different times, and it still would have been one of the best, but for Shawshank that just wasn't good enough. It kept going until you felt the ending was so perfect, that you truly had to sit back breathless. I love this movie and it will always be one of the best as far as I am concerned. A true classic!
An analysis of prison life--and of what hope can be in a prison--Frank Darabont's first film is one of the best ever. Well-written and well-acted, the story of the development of friendship between Red and Andy is charming, endearing, poignant. Nothing about this movie is overwrought or extraneous--it's simply extraordinary drama.
Its a perfect example of a movie that never gets old. Love it.

I have grown up watching Bollywood movies, full of overacting by overpaid, overfed 'heroes'. It was in college that i got to see some fine Hollywood films and this one was probably the finest of the lot. This film at first appears to be a story about life in prison. It fully describes every small experience of a person serving a long prison sentence. Life is not easy there for a lot of reasons. The screenplay is ably supported by Morgan Freeman's brilliant narration offering a second-person view of life in shawshank. But Tim Robbins steals the show by aptly underplaying the part of a wrongly sentenced, wealthy banker.The last forty minutes of this film, however, help raise it a couple of levels above other cinematic masterpieces. You don't need a weapon to fight. It is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.
First when I saw how huge the overall rating was I wondered why. But then I told myself I should give it try, and truly it was totally worth it period. I miss this kind of movies. sush a masterpiece, it contain many lessons and significances about our life I'm still wondering how this masterpiece didn't win a oscar then I figured out that it is a small thing comparing this movie and if you don't watch it yet then you have miss a big part from your life
After ten years, I watched this movie again. I wanted to see whether my thoughts will change or not, because ten years ago I did not understand why this movie is at the top. Still, I think it should not be even in top 50 movies, because nothing is special. Years are passing just like a moment, I could not feel his pain or hope. In one scene, he wants something than bum it is happening. Again, for one scene his situation is so bad, than guess what happens? After just 30 seconds, he is good. So you never go top or down during this movie. My suggestion is it is better to watch this movie without the number 1 expectations. The best coutes: "I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged." - Red


This is the best movie ever, I have watched a lot of movies and this one is the best of them all. The end irks great and it is just so damn good, watch the damn movie.

The film's been IMDb's #1 for as long as I can remember. That doesn't really raise my expectations, considering I don't agree with so many inclusions or exclusions. I thought this was absolutely fantastic. Yes, it's pretty sentimental in a big way, but unlike that year's Best Picture winner, it tells a captivating, simple yet intriguing story that manages to earn its emotion with some really heartfelt characters and superb writing. It's hard to hold anything against it (if you liked it, of course) when it's so unpretentious and gentle. Freeman is fantastic, unsurprisingly, but Tim Robbins is so bloody brilliant in this. Watching Rectify now, Aiden Young seems to be playing in the same ballpark in terms of the similarity in his portrayal.
This is such a spectacular and mysterious movie. The lead guy plays his role like a Loki.

I first saw this movie back in high school.

It was one of the best movies I seen during that time. The story with out a doubt was remarkable. It's filled with twists and what the heck moments.
"The Shawshank Redemption" is the best movie of all times according to over a million voters. When I saw this movie I was amazed because of the plot of this movie and that was something that made this movie so special.

I also liked this movie very much because of the cast of this movie. Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne) and Morgan Freeman (Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding) made one of the best performances of their life. Deserves to be noted that Bob Gunton (Warden Norton) made an also good performance.

I really recommend this movie to you and I am sure that you will love it because it's a movie that can teach you many things about life and the relationships between people and friends.


Thanx to everybody who helped to put Shawshank back to rank 2 in the top 250, in front of LotR3, where it belongs. I've seen this movie about 20 times and I never get tired of it. That's what makes a movie the best. The first 2 in the top 250 are where they belong. The 3 LotR-movies should be out of the top 10. They should create a category for special effects. Put them on top there. But for a great movie it need a lot more then effects. The story of Shawshank is absolutely great. The actors did their best. It's still a shame, that this great movie didn't got a single Oscar. It could have win the best picture in most years against all winners.
The best jailhouse movie of all time! Right next to The Green Mile!

What we have here is another classic collectible. If you have or have not seen this film, it's one of those that have to be in your DVD collection... a film to pass down to the younger generation to inspire them on how film-making should be done.

An all star cast with outstanding performances and directing!

If you don't own this, add it to your collection!

A perfect and well deserves 10/10 from me!
I do not know, what to say, I am just bored. Many people say that is the best Movie? False
This is a great film. It is well constructed, the acting is superb and the characters are so likeable or in the case of the pigs so detestable.

This movie is a mystery to me. I couldn't find anything exceptional on it. It's another HBO stuff, without any aesthetic achievement and It's absolutely conformist. But there is a fact: people love it. I want to be fair: the movie is OK, but people put it in the same place than The Godfather! Maybe I'm wrong, but it's not the best picture of all the times, not even the best prison picture of all the times. Now I'm remembering "Cool Hand Luke" or "American Me", they are stronger and wiser. But..people has the last word.
The Shawshank Redemption is the BEST movie of all time for many reasons. The first reason being that Morgan Freeman did his best acting job, and that is saying something. Freeman is the greatest actor of all time. Secondly, Tim Robbins gets so into his part you feel like the story is totally true and you are actually seeing it first hand. The supporting actors are wonderful as well. Enough about the acting which was second to none but the story was so compelling. The audience feels sympathy for the main character and wishes for him to be redeemed, in the end its just a feel good story. I cannot express this enough, GO WATCH THE MOVIE NOW! It is awesome and will never be topped.


This movie is a fine way to spend 140 minutes, but is by no means a movie of the first rank. The script is far too simplistic, cliché-ridden and predictable. The characters are far too good guy/bad guy dualistic; and for a story purporting to take place over the course of 20 years, there is remarkably little character development. And, just about every really evil character gets his comeuppance, whereas the people we're supposed to be rooting for end up in clover. Hmmmm....

Among prison movies, Cool Hand Luke is better--more realistic, and without the obligatory Hollywood feel-good ending. Runaway Train and Papillon are also very good, certainly more interesting. Among inspirational movies, last year's October Sky is a better bet.

In a nutshell: tremendously overrated, but certainly worth seeing.

Filmmakers that plan to make use of Stephen King's writings in the future need to pull an Orson Welles and watch this about 40 times before they get into it. And read the short story just as many times. This is the best transfer of a Stephen King story I've ever seen. I would give it to Kubrick's The Shining, but it's more like Kubrick took the story idea and did his own movie on it. In other words, while it's a classic, it's not that great of an adaption. Andy Dufresne is wrongly imprisoned for murdering his philanderous wife and while in prison befriends a prisoner named Red, who is great at getting outside products to the inmates. The message of the film is strong and clear : Hope Hope Hope is a beautiful thing. The film is about triumph. About friendship. It's also about some knockout acting. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are at the top of their game. A Must see. Especially if you are a fan of Stephen King's short story.
That was alot af time passing that I wanted to watch this film but something was avoiding me ... I do'nt know what was that but finally I decided to watch and I surprised... what a beautiful movie is this ...
This film should not be(as many else films)in top 3 of the 250 best films ever made.First I want to say something about the acting, that is one of the things that makes this one so good.Morgan Freeman is fantastic and so is Tim Robbins(both of them are very good actors even if Freeman is better).The script is also fantastic and the whole complex of the film is brilliant.

It´s a film that might will bring you to tears, even if it in the end goes to far and everything becomes silly.I mean it could they could have cut out the last fifteen minutes but it´s still a frightening film.The message in the film are that you will survive as long as you have hope.4,5/5

This movie is one of the few movies that I love to see over and over again. Each time I see it, I learn more and more. Like figuring out the joke about "salvation lies within." I also learned that the movie is more about Red than it is about Andy. It is as if Andy was sent there by God to give Red hope and to bring good to what was evil within. This movie has everything a movie needs. It makes you laugh, cry, and feel really good, giving you a feeling of hope.

The Shawshank Redemption is a true masterpiece and a genius work of cinematic excellence. It is a true testament to human will, friendship, and determination. Quite possibly the greatest film ever made. The clashing themes of evilness and goodness within the prison system makes this film the compelling, and satisfying story it entails.
i watched this movie just to pass out some good time... and you know what.. i had sore and wet eyes at the end.. i don't know why but the movie's end, couldn't stop myself..

andy's portrayal by tim robbins and red's by morgan freeman was absolutely great..

i like and love andy's philosophy that "hope is a good thing.." .. and i have tried to inculcate that in me.. i just loved the movie.. i was like.. whats this, its ended so fast.. i didn't it want to end.. i am not a con and neither i wanna be.. but it has shown even the guys out there in the prisons also can be innocent.. and to prove their innocence they can go to any lengths.. i mean that they also have got something in them.. their hearts.. the spirit shown by andy was absolutely great.. it shows that when you want to do something, do it with full heart.. i have just finished it..but i'm sure i m gonna watch this very often, and am not going to forget it for a long length of time..
This is easily the best movie of the '90s. Or maybe one of the best movies of the '90s. Stephen King's sure does show us that he can make awesome books besides horrors. He also made The Green Mile. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are excellent in this excellent movie. they both should've won Academy Awards for this one. Definitely. I love this movie. I must have saw this movie about 20 times. It is as great as the critics say it is. The direction for this is amazing.

Overall the whole movie is great and I am surprised that Stephen King made such a good novel. I've made my mind for the best movie of the '90s. Rating 11 out of 10. (Best Movie of the '90s)

Everyone talks about the "best ever". But how can you Judge the best? Shawshank is one of those movies that is one of those "the best film ever". It has all the elements that make it stand out fro the rest. Morgan Freeman makes this film, his acting and more importantly, his voice in the narrative. The 'critics" wrote this movie off; what do they know? This is one of the best movies of all time, and there are some awesome creations to stand up amongst. Shawshank is a legend of the movie world.
One of the best movies ever,Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were so good.
I dont know whats so special about this movie that made people idolize it but i have to admit: Its well written, directed, acted with a nice relaxing music that surrounds this story. It is a good movie that you can see again and again but its not the ultimate inspiration for me and it didn't touch my soul. I give high rating though because of all the above i stated.

This movie is one that gives to wit the most part of being happy in this life. It is true that you might not be lucky enough in life but even in the midst of crap, even when all your life has crumbled over your face, hope is still your last hope.

One night he caught his wife cheating and was thrown in jail for a murder that he had not committed and after all that he got raped! What would you have done had you been in his shoes? keep on hoping? Well, Andy not only had hope, he gave hope to his fellow prisoners. The brilliant Morgan Freeman gives the cherry on the top in this movie and if he weren't in this movie, the movie would have lacked something for sure.

There are scenes and lines that you will never forget in this movie and I have commented on hundreds of movies but very few I gave the full 10 out of 10 and this movie is one of those few.

The Shawshank Redemption :-

Classic Prison Break Movie.

Worth Watching .

9.3 in IMDB Worth for its Hype and Ratings .

Fast Paced Movie . Intriguing.

Interesting Dailogues .

Pre Climax Scenes were 🔥🔥🔥🔥.
I saw this film back in high school after having read Stephen King's novel. I fought to give this film a nine, but the more I think about it, this is absolutely a ten film. It may not be my personal favourite movie, but I really enjoy it. If I see it playing on television I have to stop and watch. Shawshank Redemption is all about hope which is expressed by Andy. The twists and turns that play out keep you entertained for the entire runtime with a message no one will soon forget. I for one quote the movie all the time. It's absolutely brilliant and the epitome of film structure.
I have been waiting a long time to watch this movie and I couldn't be more pleased. The Shawshank Redemption is something like I have never seen before. The story was brilliant from beginning to end and it is definitely something that I will never forget. The acting was wonderful, the story was genius, and the whole movie was just so beautifully done. I cannot find a single flaw and therefore, I gave it a 10/10. This movie is now, perhaps, one of my favorites and I think that it is absolutely essential to watch.
I know 'Best Movie Ever' sounds like such a cliché, a phrase used to death. Many people use it on movies which really do not deserve to be called the best movie ever. I believe that the phrase ' Best Movie Ever' should be reserved for one movie only. The Shawshank Redemption. Not so long ago on IMDb, The Shawshank Redemption was ranked 2nd. This, naturally, compelled me to buy it, and then i discovered what makes up a truly great movie.Simple plot, wonderfully acted and directed.Since watching The Shawshank Redemption, i have been preaching to all my friends to watch it. And here i must do the same. It is ranked #1 on IMDb for a reason. It is the best ever. It will move you. You will love it. If you haven't seen it, watch it.10/10

An outstanding movie about perseverance, brains and irony. It's certainly the greatest prison movie ever made. But there's a lot more involved than your average prison flick has to offer. Try character and character development for starters.

The best thing King has written, I love "Salems Lot" but how can you top this one.
Fresh movie. Very good. I do be liking Morgan Freeman and Andy Dufreshne.
I have to admit that I've discovered the existence of this movie by looking to the top rated movies on IMDb and this one has the highest rank of all the films ever made. I was clearly curious, why so high? Why this movie in particular is the best according to the other IMDb's users? Well after watching it I can say that it's not something wrong to have The Shawshank Redemption so high. It's not my favorite film ever but it's a very very good one that I'll suggest everyone who didn't see it to go and watch it. This movie is great in every aspect: performances, direction, plot, settings... But what makes it so great is that it provokes a lot of emotions in the viewers that stay with them for a while after the viewing. There are a lot of powerful moments and scenes and they are all well built in order to have more impact. And furthermore the movie is also able to stimolate a reflexion about various topics about prisons system, justice and human nature in general. In conclusion The Shawshank Redemption is clearly a must-watch, don't lose this masterpiece.

Let me tell you a little story. I am 17 years old and consider myself an avid movie buff. From Braveheart to American History X to Pulp Fiction to Schindler's List to The Matrix, I thoroughly enjoy watching and talking about great movies. After being desensitized by the poor gore-fest known as Hostel, I came home and watched this movie with some friends. Let me tell you that this is one of two movies I can think of that has made me tear up. I don't do it often, and I certainly wasn't expecting to tonight. But the Shawshank Redemption tantalizes your mind and touches your soul. It is a triumph of motion picture and tonight became of of my top five favorite movies of all time. Please go see this in its entirety if you have not.

It is year 2009 and yet this movie is still the best movie I have ever seen. It truly and rightfully deserves to be the best movie of all times. Story telling, acting, directing, anything that you can imagine about a movie is so perfectly done. I believe everyone will have his own message from the movie but if you want to see a movie that tells how important the role of hope in our life is, you are at the correct address. The atmosphere in the prison, the way people feel and the way all these things were put together in a two hours movie; there is nothing to say. It is just exceptionally plain good. A must to see movie for everyone that carries a heart.

What to say about this movie. I still regret not watching it after several recommendations. This is a complete masterpiece. All the actors have done great job.

Now talking about the movie it has a very deep message. It says hope is the thing a man should always have. Fear can hold you a prisoner but hope can set you free. And being free doesn't mean freedom from prison, but from negative thoughts that brought you down here. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shared a great bond of throughout the movie and we really do care about them. It is a masterpiece and one must watch it at least once in his/her life....
The Shawshank Redemption is with out a doubt one of the most over rated films of the 90s. There have been many intriguing prison movies over the years, Shawshank is not one of them. Instead it's sentimental slop served to uplift the souls of the American people. There is never any sense in the film that Tim Robbin's character is in true danger. If the film wanted to show the true horror of prison maybe it should of been far more darker, instead of inspiration. Morgan Freeman is wasted as usual, in the role of wisdom spouting inmate. Freeman's character is mainly there to look wise and bring inspiration to us all, but he is never treated as a typical person. Tim Robbins is good, but his character is all good, while the prison warden is sure evil. Everything is black and white. Shawshank has potential to be great, but director Frank Darabant's obsession with being Frank Capra ruins the film at every turn.
I figured prison life to be much harsher, as seen in other films. This is the films only weak point, but then the story would suffer if the film was like Fight club. This is a story about a man who loses everything but still survives. He uses his intelligence to outwit his attackers, and function in prison. No matter what happens he still kept his dreams alive. What is a man without dreams? The word institutionalized is used in this film to describe what the prison does to the individual. Tim Robbins will not have the inner freedom of who he is change to what the prison dictates. There are many interesting subplots that keeps the viewer's attention. These subplots culminate into a unforgettable conclusion.
TSR is a movie about prisoners searching for freedom. This movie contains many good acting, good story, and good cinematography. Altough it cant stand among superior classic movies, but it is prudent to tell TSR is a complete package of entertainment. TSR is a core of prison-escape genre.

This movie is an art of philosophy.
I'm not going to go in detail about the brilliance of the Shawshank Redemption; it would be too much and the most haas already been said. For me,it is a tie between this and 1960's Psycho as the best movie ever. It does what nearly no movie does. It climbs through your skin, into your soul. If you have watched it already, go watch it again and if you have not, go buy yourself a blu ray and watch it. There's nothing more to say about it. If there was ever a 11/10 movie, the Shawshank Redemption would be this movie.
When I first saw this film I wasn't that Mesmorised but as I thought about it I began to notice it's Symbolism. The more I thought about it the more I liked it and now it is my second favorite movie. Morgan Freeman is one of the best actors of are generation and the thing I love most about him is his voice. Tim Robbins is perfect as a quit sincere Andy Dufranse.This is one of the best movies ever made and deserves more publicity from critics.

This movie provides positive proof that the IMDb website has security holes. Somehow the family members of the filmmakers hacked the system to grossly inflate the votes for this movie. How else to explain the No. 2 ranking of a film that probably does not belong in the Top 2000? It is an entertaining prison yarn but there are at least twenty prison movies that are superior to this and the filmmakers had the good sense to borrow from these (I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, The Great Escape, Cool Hand Luke, etc.). In fact, the same director's The Green Mile, which is also based on a Stephen King story and set in a prison, is a better film. On the acting front, Robbins and Freeman are always watchable.
Enough has been said of this masterpiece, so I'll keep my review succinct. This truly is my favorite movie of all-time, because no matter how many times I see it, I still get the genuine feeling of hope the film has delivered since the first time I saw it. Everything about this movie is perfect; from the cinematography, to the acting, the casting, the writing...everything. It's a fantastic example of the power of hope and the true nature of the human spirit. When you watch it, you just know that every scene is classic; so many moments will be remembered forever in film history. If anything, it just keep getting better with each time I see it. I will continue to enjoy this film for the rest of my life.
Little more than average drama for popular tastes. Predictable, overly sentimental, and excessively long.

It's a mystery to me that such a mediocre piece of cinematic art is at number 2 in the all time chart! However, predictably it's not in the top 100 more serious 'Sight and Sound' critics and directors polls that are held every ten years. Frank Darabont later proved to be no master with his two following films, the second rate 'The Green Mile' and the truly appalling 'The Majestic'. The fact that this pedestrian movie is, in this chart, ahead of the works of real masters such as Kubrick, Welles, Kurosawa, Fellini and Hitchcock causes consternation.
Well the thing with this movie is its message. While it might not be the first or only prison break movie, the way it's directed and its amazing cinematography and score has turned this average plot movie into a great movie. The dialogues are superb, mostly short and on-point! And the cherry on the cake is Morgan Freeman( specially his voice).

It's a timeless movie that you'll re-visit time and time again and you'll watch the complete movie and protagonist's struggle just to get to that light of hope in the climax. Couldn't agree more on the fact that it must have been the most revisited movie of all time... And isn't that enough to make it the best movie of all time?
I'm one of those repetitive mucks who'll watch the same movie every weekend for three months or until I feel I've had enough. Shawshank is one of those films I have seen at least ten times and yet, it is still new. The truth is, you're never really immune to the human drama portrayed by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both excellent here. This is not a feel-good Friday night flick. It's about injustice, desperation, the overcoming of that desperation, and the will to live regardless of time or circumstance. Shawshank set no records at the box office and was largely ignored until gradually, it was recognized as the masterpiece it undoubtedly is. Roger Ebert attributes the movie's financial flop to its unassuming name.

I noticed the film is right at the top of the IMDB's Top 250 films list, and rightfully so!!! Some movies have one or two really glorious scenes. But Shawshank is one continuing memorable scene. There is not one line of stale dialogue or awkwardness. I can't do it justice here, so do yourself a favor and rent it NOW.





This movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story, cast, screenplay all are great. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and couldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is the best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.

I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. If you haven't watch it yet, just GO! Watch it! Now!
The Shawshank Redemption is a beautiful film. The last fifteen minutes are so wonderful it made me cry - and the only other film that has made me cry is the climax of The Truman Show. This is a film that makes you see life in a completely different way - a hopeful way. Don't watch some shallow nonsense like Mission Impossible II, watch a film that you'll remember your entire life. Watch The Shawshank Redemption. It's got 9 out of 10 for a reason, you know.

I always really enjoyed The Shawshank Redemption and my appreciation remains consistent with repeated viewings. With a 9.3 IMDB rating decades after it's release shows that this is a movie that speaks to people and I have not met anyone who doesn't like this movie. Among Steven King adaptations this is probably the best, I like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, just as much for different reasons. But don't tell Steven King that, lol. The Shawshank Redemption is much more than a prison movie, it's an absolutely engrossing movie that has audiences glued to the screen from start to finish. Director Frank Darabond did a fantastic job putting this together with top notch cinematography, direction and a great attention to detail. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give unforgettable performances. The Shawshank Redemption is flawless filmmaking and storytelling that has few films that are it's equal. All and all, The Shawshank Redemption is perfect in my book and is recommended to anybody who wants to see a great movie.

In my opinion, The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film ever made. The acting is on par and the directions is pretty darn close to perfection. The Shawshank redemption is one of those films that is designed to make you think, and boy does it do its job.

The screenplay is possibly one of the greatest ever scripted. The way it cleverly weaves in and out is extraordinary. Stephen King should be proud that a film like this originated from his book.

The Shawshank Redemption is the perfect movie. I don't think anyone could give it lower than a 7. The film will appeal to anyone, if not everyone, and will leave you vey satisfied long after the credits roll.
There are some things in this world which are beyond those 26 Alphabets. We cannot always accurately explain or express them. So, Instead we should experience them. We should admire the beauty and creativity involved. This movie is really one of those things. You should experience this yourself. Worth of your time for sure !!!
Probably yes, acting was good, plot brilliant, I mean Stephen King wrote the book, but it can't match the film. When I sow this movie I thought "thats it, this is it, best movie ever". Sure you can find people who didn't like it, and when I ask "why", and try to guess what then happened? They just confused themselves, they can say reason why they don't like this movie... When I try to read comments with 1/10 star, I can't find comment with good reasons that could make me realize, that this movie is a bad movie, If there is no reason, then this means, that its the best movie ever made!The only reason people are giving 1 star is that they don't like ratio "9,2", they want to do more effect by pull this high ratio down, I really hate them :) Sorry for my bad English language, I live in EUrope, my English teacher is big cow with no knowledge...
Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life changes drastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows how Andy, with the help of his friend Red, the prison entrepreneur, turns out to be a most unconventional prisoner.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great in one of the best movies ever made
I decided to see the movie because it's the #1 rated movie on here. I really had no other choice. The movie didn't look special though. An average movie. The movie is neither good or poor. I've seen many movies which are far better I reckon. I can't believe "The Shawshank Redemption" is the #1 rated movie on this website. I don't hate the movie. The movie is still decent. I'm just giving a fair assessment. More than 2,000,000 people rated the movie which is a record. I checked the figures for other movies such as "The Dark Knight", and it's not too far behind "The Shawshank Redemption". There's competition regarding the best ranked movie. You need to see the top 250 movies on here, and the margins/ratings of these movies are neck and neck. But I just don't think the movie I'm writing a review on is that #1 ranked movie. In fact, I don't reckon Morgan Freeman thinks "The Shawshank Redemption" is his best movie. You seen his movies. I'm glad I seen the movie though. The setting is at a prison named Shawshank. 5/10.
This line suits the film best, as I'm watching it after 27 years but still never saw such great direction & screenplay.

This movie is truly a masterpiece in every aspect from giving the message to character development.
All is perfect : the complexity of the characters, the suspense, the principals themes like friendship, loneliness, injustice, redemption, vengeance, freedom... The most complete movie that i've ever seen. Tim Robbins is great, sensitive, brilliant: in one scene, he can feel a thousand of feelings. Freeman is very correct and seems to be really "Red". Gunton, Sadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of peace. Titanic is pure entertainment and received 11 oscars. This movie deserves 30 oscars because it shows what is really important in life. No action, more realistic, more useful than the other films. It was really a BIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it. When i see it again, I think and I realize the incredible power that the cinema's industry have. In a different way, only Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and some others have the same impact.





My Personal Rating 9.8/10 - This is one of the most beautiful film that i have watched, same thing on godfather the cinematography the acting the atmosphere are so beautifully crafted. this film leaves me speechless it almost change the way that i think, i do believe this movie has some lessons on it. the way Morgan Freeman narrates the movie is so beautiful.. the quotes too. i don't want to spoil anything. anyone should watch this film.
Even in the worst place there is.. you can still hope for the best, dare to dream and achieve it.
Stephen King is my favorite writer and I've read all of his books. When I first learned of them making a movie of "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption" I was excited. I'd always liked the story, and thought it would make a great movie. But I was also apprehensive, because most movies don't do the book they're based on justice, especially when it comes to Steve's books. But I'm glad to say that I worried about nothing. Very glad. The Shawshank Redemption is one of the very best movies from a Stephen King book ever made, and one of my favorite movies of all time. My score-10.
it is the most great film in the history of American cinema. Robbins and freeman are fantastic. it implants hope in our soul. friendship relation between the Robbins and freeman in the film is very nice. i know that movie is the first in the IMDb schedule , and its really worth it. When I watch any movie I always return to your appreciation of it and relied upon, but in this film I've seen just so, I said it deserved to be the best and when I returned to the evaluation have really found is also.But I do not know why did not achieve high income while movie display, but perhaps it was due to have been introduced in the early nineties of the last century, and the film does not usually attracts young researcher substance or sexual violence.
I have just watched this movie and I still don't know what I've just seen. The way "The Shawshank Redemption" hit me on an emotional level was completely new to me. I was emotionally torn apart by this great piece of art. For some reason I have always avoided watching this movie because I didn't think that I'd like it as much as most people. But I was so wrong! I am in love with this movie! I have never seen such a heartbreaking and beautifully crafted movie such as this one. I fully and strongly recommend "The Shawshank Redemption" to everyone who still hasn't seen it. What a masterpiece! 10/10
this film is very convincing hokum. nice, gentle, inoffensive and insubstantial story about prison life - I came away feeling prison was a place where nobody says f##k or fears bending over to pick up the soap. check out Freeman, in the token performance of his career, neatly basking in the falsely accused smart white gentleman robbins' shaddow. what a team... so very progressive. 'hope...' . oh yeah, we've got a lot of 'hope' going on here. The lush fantasy kind, so deadly sweet and full of bull. frank darabont is a gifted man who excels in making pretty pictures that strike at the very heart of american pie values and gives them a welcome support by elevating tokenism to its greatest levels in hollywood yet - that is no small achievement, considering... if you don't believe me check out his latest masterpiece, he just can't stop doing it. hell, why not! it sells tickets.
If you are looking for an inspiring jorney to feel the magic of life, you should stop searching and watch this title.

This movie is more of a drama than action, but that doesn't matter, because it would fail in either case. A viewer can accept the cliché of the wrongly convicted man, but this case is deceptively against the grain. Our society already has a predisposition to acquit any man of murdering his wife, a predisposition to think it is impossible, when the statistics claim the opposite. For that reason alone, this movie is dangerous propaganda, and most often a lie. The characters never become believable, mostly because of the reason stated earlier. Also, because such men don't wind up in prison. The wrongly convicted man always comes from a different background and class. I can't imagine someone finding this movie even remotely plausible. In fact, the viewer has no idea what the "redemption" is. Nothing makes any sense.
It has a formula that gives you this kick; Darn what a good movie! But I need to say this, sometimes it happens.. So WHY do people love this movie and rate it high, when, or WHY isn't the "smart" people declare it like a a peace of art? Or do they?! Still I think it's darn good...but I bet the producer(s) didn't expect that!

Like when we vote, for anything, we need to follow our heart. This is a typical movie that is worth every penny, every letter... and it's a typical 90' movie! Oh.. there we have it! Between gone with the wind and now, we NEED this! Love me as I am.. says the storyline, in my head anyway. And I do, yes I do!

In 100 years there will be 'Casablanca.' There will be 'Citizen Kane.' There will be '2001, A Space Oddessy.' There will be 'The Godfather.' And there will be 'The Shawshank Redemption.' It is amazing that this much overlooked film has in six years reached the stature of a Hollywood legend, not only in my estimation but in the opinion of almost everyone I've spoken to about it. This movie has gained a larger audience through word of mouth than it had the entire time it was in the theaters. This is quite simply one of the three best movies I've ever seen.

Don't watch this movie, you will never see anything better and any other movie will disappoint you somehow. This movie is perfect and you can't imagine anything better.

I'm a big Stephen King fan, and I wondered if this movie would be a good adaptation. Some of King's work has been great on film, but others have not translated well. No fear. As others have noted, this is an amazing film that provides inspiration and reconnects the viewer with the inner core of humanity. The script is great, the directing is wonderful, and the performances are unbelievably good. To give you some idea of just HOW GOOD this is, the first time I saw it was on an airline. Problem was, the headset didn't work and there weren't any other headsets. The movie is so good that I couldn't stop watching it--and this is a movie heavy on dialogue. If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor. NOTE: It's even better with the sound!!!
I had this movie in my watch list for so many days but didn't watch it going by the title and the cover image. After watching it, I see that the movie didn't do well in box office for the same reason: strange title, unrelated cover image and confusions over marketing. But after watching it once, I want to watch it again and again. It is such an inspiration. Amazing acting and direction. Flawless, motivational and entertaining as well. Once we watch movies like this and Forrest Gump, we just feel that other scores of movies we watched is just a waste of time. Watch the movie, understand the lessons and adopt it. It surely adds value to our life, not just a couple of hours of time pass. What more: it is entertaining as well.
This movie, is more than just a movie, this is about freedom and peace, between each other, many people will learn something watching it, about how the mind could be free when your body is not.great acting,great story and avery good script
Well, everyone seems to mention Forrest Gump in their bit about Shawshank.

So, maybe I will, too.

As a Terminator 2 fan, I feel naturally fascinated by The Shawshank Redemption. This film pushes all the buttons of a person with a caring heart.

With a brilliant cast, story line, director and set, this is a master piece rivaled only by T2, Titanic, The Rock, and perhaps Dances with Wolves.

A 8.5/10 from MaRX.
What. A. Film. Incredible film. One of the best in the history, i think whit Forrest Gump the bests. Morgan Freeman's performance is amazing. 10/10
Mostly what can been said has been said. This really isn't anywhere near he greatest movie ever made. For heaven's sake, it's a competent genre flick that runs a little too long but contains a couple of well-turned performances from the leads. Tim Robbins, incidentally, is way better in Mystic River.

Down by Law and Birdman of Alcatraz are both significantly more interesting and original prison movies than this one. Cool Hand Luke is obviously the greatest prison film of all time. Shawshank is so-so. Think about it, was there a moment, a second, a single plot turn in that film you didn't know was coming? When the young guy goes out for his little conference with the warden, did you not think 'come on, guy, haven't you seen any movies?' Predictability is satisfying I suppose, in its way, but give me originality and genuine passion every time. Shawshank has neither of those attributes. Sorry to everyone who cries every time they see it. You've been had.
Good very good its a good and i aconselho a ver fdsafsadfdsafdsaf
This movie is excellent in every way you look at it. Even the ways you don't know about it is excellent. Every time I think about this movie it makes me want to watch it again. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give one heck of a performance. A brilliant masterpiece to show how cruel the system was and how they can take away your freedom with flimsy evidence. (It was back in the 30's, it's probably the best justice system they had). And how cruel the prison system was back in the day. 2nd all time favorite move. (1st being Platoon).
The shawshank redemption is a must watchable movie because the storyline of this movie is brilliant and you will never feel bored a second while watching this movie, the acting done by all characters in this movie especially Red is really mind blowing.. this is a very simple, but heart touching movie, if you are a movie lover you should absolutely watch it.....
It is strange that this movie is 2nd in imdb chart, as it is the same old american story, where good people win, and bad guys died. More strange, the USA is still the place where this story must sound more false.
Hands down the very best movie ever made. Not much else to say.
Overrated. Drastically.

Tim Robbins is okay. Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman.
I can't say much more than I was incredibly underwhelmed by this film. Perhaps it was that I had been told what a great film it was by all and sundry, but I found it utterly average. I am afraid I just didn't get what was so fantastic about the movie. Don't get me wrong it was an entertaining film but not the masterpiece I was lead to believe it was. Sorry.
I'm really happy to see that this film is still on the very top of the ranks all these years, and rightfully so, I'm glad that most of us agree to it. Amongst many films, Shawshank Redemption touches our souls in the most humane way. A film of art indeed, but it serves its purpose to the fullest extent. It is a movie that touches the souls of real lives. It makes us feel human.

The messages in this film are worth consideration, whilst the ending is one of most beautiful ones in cinema history. But enough has been said already, and I'd repeat most of them. As a conclusion, I'm proud to have watched this film. And it won't be the last. Rejoice for Shawshank Redemption.
Run Tim Robbins's name in the database, and I don't think you'll find that he's starred in too many movies worth watching. Generally, most movies he's in have the subtlety of a ball peen hammer across your forehead. This movie atones for a thousand sins. Carefully written, deliberately paced, lovingly acted, this film brings you in and leads you to the light on the other side. Nothing is forced, but not a single plot thread is left dangling. Hollywood needs a lot more movies like this one. See it twice.

Everything touched me. I will remember this movie for the life time. This is pure masterpiece

This is a very good film, working on a number of levels. The main theme of the film is hope in adversity. I particularly like the way that Andy becomes a kind of Christ-type. It still does not quite make my own Top Ten!
I am not going to say anything about this movie. You just have to experience it for your self.
Good acting from all concerned carries the rather simplistic and obvious storyline beyond the saccharine, but the villains are really predictable in their villany and the storyline, while initially moving and affecting, seems forced and unreal once you step back from Robbins and Freeman's performances.

In other words, a high impact movie that rapidly loses credibility with considered thought after viewing. Far more worthwhile, though, than many other similarly stretched dramas and by no means a failure. But by no means in the top rank of movie making.
This movie is about the prisoners. The main character is caught in the false charge. At first, he claims his innocence, but he cannot prove it. In prison, he has his own world. Also, he is so clever. He plans something and it appears 20 years later. When the ordinary people are caught in the false charge, they may give up their life, but he never gives up. He carves out his life. I think he tells me the importance of living and having the hope. There are not so many flashy exciting scene, but there is some moving scene in an important position. They give more impression to audience. There are a lot of prison film, but I like this movie the best. I think the movie should be like this.
Strong, meaningful and everlasting message is what makes this movie such powerful. The Hope, the Life and the Friendship are elements of Great Impact and are well incorporated in this feature. But, lots of flaws also. This movie lacks originality. Approach, characters and dialogues are rather cliched and mold. Portraying of characters is loose and poor. Dialogues are pretty ordinary and too conventional. Overall approach is just Routine and the whole movie is based on the Final Impact of the story. In short, its actually not surprising no Oscar winning and no including into the 100 Greatest Movies by American Film Institute. Greater Effort in developing characters to be multidimensional and story to be less conventional would produce One of the Best. Pity. 7,5/10

Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free. A strong man can save himself. A great man can save another.
One of the best films of all times. They don't make them like they use to, and we slowly forget what art is.
The movie was a great success. The main character was very positive in all three aspects. In despair also do not give up, and through years of efforts to escape from prison to punish the wicked. The movie's main character allows himself to bring a little hope to the dark prison.
It's just sublime. Never dates. Can not fault the film or actors chosen. A must watch for any one!
This is not just a movie, it's a message for your life that if you utilise properly, your life changes forever for good. But you have to watch it thoroughly, with clean, sharp and receptive mind.
The best movie ever made, period. I won't go on a very long and detailed review on the story(which is magnificent and perfect)I just want to say that this movie is a pure piece of art. The acting was perfect! I'm really disappointed that the actors didn't have enough recognition for their performances! Actually, the overall movie was underestimate, by the Oscars especially.This movie shows why cinema is an art, powerful and heart full art. See this movie, you'll now what I'm talking about. I really tried to notice some gripes or problems but, I can't. This movie is touching, sad, beautiful, powerful and perfect. By the way, f**k the Academy Awards for dumping this movie and do for Forrest Gump for the trophies,but it's just trophies... Still a shame that they decided that.

11 out of ten, totally deserves it.
It's an "emotional manipulation for dummies" type of film, with boring direction and cardboard characters.

Nice performances by the actors though, some great moments, but nothing outside the "Hallmark meets Stephen King meets Prison" feel of the entire movie.

I saw it one and a half times, and would see it again only if I got paid for the trouble.

Similarly, I hated 'The Green Mile", only later did I find out it's the work of Darabont.

My recommendation: Skip this, and go see OZ again.
First time I saw "The Shawshank Redemption" was some two years after its release. Second time was yesterday and like every great movie it got even better this time. The movie is a beautiful story about hope that holds you above the surface even when your life seems meaningless. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins are magnificent, and this film I can recommend to anyone.
This is the gap, the gap in ideas, the gap in values. It is the gap between people, so there will be winners and losers in the world, there will be poor and rich, there will be this described by the story

It is not terrible to be trapped by high walls, for some people cannot be trapped. Birds of full plumage belong to the sky, not to be caged. But if ideas are trapped by walls, people get stuck in them
The film touches on the eternal themes of mankind and the unavoidable predicament of the present. The structure of the film is better than the original novel, the lines are more rhythmical, more refined and more profound than the original novel, and the characters are more vivid and powerful than the original novel. With rich and skillful artistic texts, the director will promote the spirit of freedom between heaven and earth.
Overall a great movie with good stuff about the movie, i really liked the movie and stuff about it and the themes and it's overall a good movie that i enjoyed.
And i think it might be the best movie of all time.


Well made movie with a great story. very long and dragged at times (2 viewings)
This is a different one... at least from the kind of movie I'm used to watch in sync with friends. Because the 'action' in the plot is around mystery and complex characters. The movie omits most of the stuff so you do the work, including the emotional work, and that I value greatly in a movie. Movies that make you feel and think, that are not obvious and bogus are the ones you should watch. Directors that don't tell you in each scene exactly the actors are feeling and thinking... no. You need adventures through each history, through realms of thought. Those are the ones you should watch. I don't want to go deep in the movie to avoid spoilers, since I write reviews for guys to decide if they are going to watch. So here is the tip: If you are looking for fun this might not be you guy. You will cry and I don't like that when movie syncing with friends. But if you want to know a history well developed around emotion, and some really funny nice characters, or even some of Morgan freeman then you should do this.

This is an amazing movie. The acting is incredible and the screenplay and direction are amazing. Extremely powerful and pretty depressing, it actually has a pretty heartwarming kind of ending and the way everything ties together at the end is simply brilliant. You must see this movie, definitely one of the better movies I've ever seen.



The best movie in history and the ending is the best ending

This classic films is one of my favourite movie of all time, and a perfect movie..well balanced by acting with a unexpected climax.
I'm not a person that cry easily but this movie God damn, what a quality!!!.
Just watched it today....better late than sorry...amazing movie.
Sorry folks but this movie is a C movie and not an A. I can't believe that people like this movie so much. Yes I am biased, I really don't like Tim Robbins but he has made a decent movie or two but this ain't one of them. This is your basic prison movie. What can I say- it has the host of usual characters. The storyline is basic, the outcome I won't say but it is just stupid to say that this is a great movie. I didn't think it was realistic at all and anybody who falls for this crap is either delusional or needs some brains to differentiate between an Edsel and a Lamborghini. I wouldn't watch this movie again unless I was paid to do so. One viewing is enough for this predictable laugher.
This is my favorite movie of all time. I have this movie in Physical format and I have it on digital and let me tell you that I will stop everything I'm doing if I catch it on cable. This movie has stood the test of time and each watch gets better. It has an epic feel to it. Freeman and Robbins absolutely kill it in this movie. Supporting cast is on point. The music will keep you in the moment and compliments the visuals till the very end.
Does it get much better than this? After 25 years of watching this, the answer is (so far), "not really".
2417th review!!!!

Superb. Great. Masterpiece. Unforgettable. Excellent. Brilliant. No, no , no. I have been thinking for months to find a word that can describe the film. Nothing's found yet and , to be honest, I think nothing will be found forever. The movie can't be expressed by words. Words are unable to talk about it and I have nothing to say about this masterpiece. But I'm hopeful to be able one day to express my feelings about it because "hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies" When it come to the Shawshank Redemption, I prefer to remain silent because "silence is full of unspoken words"
The Shawshank Redemption, based on the fantastic Stephen King novel, is a moving story about Andy Dufresne, an innocent man charged with the murder of his wife and her lover who is sentenced to 40 years in prison and fights hard to survive, but in prison he forms a rare and close friendship with fellow inmate Ellis 'Red' Redding. The film more or less focuses on the friendship between Andy and Red, played beautifully by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, Morgan's deep and moving voice was perfect to describe the closeness of his friendship with Andy. The film had a great happy ending where Andy escaped from the prison after serving almost 20 years, he also managed to expose the prison as there was murder and corruption going on there, Andy moves to a beautiful island abroad and when Red is paroled after serving 40 years in prison he is reunited with Andy, it was a great ending to a beautiful movie.
This movie is an amazing movie. It's not comparable . Friendship is an amazing thing.

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were splendid in this look at the horrors of prison life. Great camera work, acting, and a believable script led to a realistic feeling movie. This is only the second King book that made a good film; "The Stand" being the other.
Few movies in this world are as powerful as The Shawshank Redemption. This well-crafted drama drags your emotions through the wringer, only to have them come out clean & full of hope on the other side. The story is unquestionably compelling and absolutely memorable. In addition, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and the rest of the cast create a collage of authentic characters that you both love & hate. This is a film that everyone should watch at least once a year to remind themselves of how good it really is.

This is without a doubt, the best film of the 90's. Morgan Freeman is brilliant as Red, his story is just as compelling as Andy Dufrense's. Only repeated viewings made me realise this. Another oscar tragedy that Forrest Gump won best picture over this, typical USA USA carry on. This story also proves Stephen King as a wonderfull writer and not just a one-dimensional horror novelist. So heartwarming, great humour particularly from the head prison guard and the best, most bitter sweet revenge in any film I can think of. A no questions asked 10/10.
I'm sorry, I can't buy these guys as criminals, and that ruined the "suspension of disbelief" for me. Otherwise, an excellent story.

Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising "twist" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.
This is by far my favourite film ....I can watch it anytime and it brings out the same emotions I felt when I watched it for the first time....a film par excellence with immaculate performances....must watch !!!
Everything that a good movie can have is there is this movie.
Absolutely adore this movie. it was incredible to watch
Don't miss it! Such an amazing acting, extraordinary screenplay and what not?

go ahead and watch it guys.

There are few movies that capture and identify with the American male spirit. Shawshank is one of those movies. I don't care what anyone's take is on prison treatment or whether you are conservative or liberal, this movie is moving. There are three movies, in my opinion, that every man, or developing man, should watch: Shawshank Redemption, Dancing With Wolves, and Brave Heart. Unless you are a total pansy, these are the movies that will confirm your heterosexuality. Andy Dufrane is the person in us. Red is the person we want to be. Aside from the being in prison, the job they have is well apt to the people of this great nation.
Why do you like this so much? It steals directly from every other GOOD prison movie I've ever seen: The Great Escape, Escape from Alcatraz, Midnight Express, you name it. Because it allows the hero to be raped it's somehow brave or profound or heaven forbid realistic. Far from it folks. The work of hacks, only the MAIN performances are redeemable. How 'bout that warden, quite a 3 dimensional character that one. As are all the peripherals. Its bad, but in an average hollywood way. Of course it's overblown but it entertains decent enough in that much. Nothing memorable, infact I'd have forgotten it totally if it weren't for the persistant and oh so undeserved praise heaped upon it. But hey if it does it for you more power to you. Just don't talk about it's "power" in front of me, I may puke.
Really, after all this time, why write about Shawshank now? Well, simply, it's still the best movie I've ever watched.... 10 times. This is a movie that from start to finish keeps you engaged like no other film. When it concludes you wonder how a 2 hour plus movie can go by so quickly. No bathroom breaks or snack breaks during this movie, whether it's the first time watching it, or your tenth. Just sat down and watched it again 2 nights ago with my daughter (12). She too never moved from the couch and loved the film. This film will hold up to the test of time because it's simple: great writing, great acting, great directing and watchable over and over.
Shawshank redemption is probably one of the greatest movies out there hands down. Its a story about a banker named Andy Dufresne who is sentenced to life in prison for killing his wife and her secret lover.At first for Andy it seems that life has taken a toll for the worst while he goes through the first initial weeks in Shawshank.Fortunately he befriends a group of the inmates over the course of his time there. Mainly a character named Red who has some push on things that go down in the prison. Red and Andy learn a lot of lessons from each other and become really great friends over their course of time at Shawshank. The dialogue in this movie is not only enticing, but also has a bit of comic relief here and there. To me this movie mainly revolves not only the character development of Andy as a man sent to jail for life, but mainly about the human condition and what it is like to no longer be a free man. Andy's' most important lesson that he learns in Shawshank is that while they can take virtually everything away from you including your pride and your dignity, they can never take your Hope.
I shall be short with no spoilers about the movie.

This is a superb picture. Everything is right, spot on right. Beautiful acting, good camera work and a soundtrack that really helps the movie to that extra level. It is a slow, but not too slow, unraveling story with some nice twists and turns in it, all with a good ending.

Do not expect much comedy and quick action, but a good story.

My recommendation: 10 out of 10 points
There are several amazing movies that are 9 but Shawshank is the only perfect 10 that I've given because it is so rewatchable.



I'm not sure Shawshank Redemption deserves to be considered the best film of all-time, personally I'm not sure I would even have it in the top 50. Regardless, this is still a majestic and thoroughly entertaining movie with an unforgettable finale. The lead performances from both Robbins and Freeman are career-defining and help make the film so memorable.
This film gave me the maximal inspirations and deeply touched my inner heart as I finally knew how to cope with everything when the whole world goes against you, and the way to get over everything when the god unleash the hell on you. For me, I am now facing the greatest challenge ornament my life as I have to conquer all sorts of difficulties to successfully get the good grades in my university

I am not a big fan of Stephen King books. Therefore, it came as a complete surprise that this compelling story was written by the "King of Horror" himself. Never has any other movie entertained in so many different ways. It manages to be disturbing and uplifting, both funny and moving. Morgan Freeman is top notch as usual, and Tim Robbins gives his best performance as lead character Andy Dufresne. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favour and buy it from your local video store. You won't regret it.
Wish I could go back in time and see it for the first time again, because the story moved me deeply. Fantastic movie all the way through, not a single issue to report here.
The difference between this story about prison in the middle of the 20th Century and any other movie is just about everything. From the great acting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman to the outstanding directing, this movie just makes the viewer feel as if they spent their time doing something worthwhile. The ending of the movie makes the movie, but without all of the other parts leading up to the finale, there would be nothing as well. Almost every scene in this has a point and a reason. Watching others view this movie for the first time, I've noticed that the interest is usual only at an average level during the first third of the film, but as the viewer is drawn in, they soon can't take their eyes off of it. Only the best of movies will have all of these qualities, and with it being a happy, successful story in the end, few can deny its greatness.
I usually hate popular movies(pulp fiction, titanic, forest gump). So I was very sceptical when I sat down to watch the currently 4th ranked movie on the imdb. What can i say, I agree, this movie gets a 10, while some things are hard to believe(his escape) the range of this movie makes it easy to ignore. There is a lot of depth here. You get to see all the characters grow and age, you really get drawn in to the plot. It shows how brutal prison can be. And how dependent on the system one can become. Another minor thing I didn't like was how after "The Sisters" leader was beaten and transfered the prison seem to be a utopia except for the guards. There should have been at least a little inmate-to-inmate brutality shown.

A great addition to your DVD collection.
I watched this film several times and I am fascinated with it today as I was then when I watched it. Everything is top of the line. Acting, plot, camera, everything.

Plot involving jail in 1940s is really an interesting plot and characters are really colorful. I think that was one of the films when Morgan Freeman came to fame. Other actors are fantastic too. This story is timeless and it will probably be watched many times over and over again by many people in the future.

However, I am not sure that it deserves to be number one on IMDb top 250 films of all times. I would put Schindler*s list there rather then this film. But that is just me.

Thank you Tim Robbins, you are the only reason I could sit through this long winded tale of garbage. As far as prison movies go, this suffers from an identity crisis is. Tries to do too much by not actually doing anything at all story wise. Watch Cool Hand Luke instead
Darabonts film about an innocent banker and his troubles inside a maximum security prison with a tough warden (Gunton). Andy (robbins) befriends an inmate whose friendship gives him hope and is the backbone of the film, Morgan Freeman plays this role superbly in what i think is the actor's best performance of all time. This is Freeman's film, though Robbins is great in the lead and Gunton is a hell of an antagonist. Everything about this film is perfect, so i can completely see why its the 3rd best film of all time on IMDb. I am a big fan and have watched it 5 times and wouldn't mind on seeing it again later down the line. IMDb Rating: 9.2 MY Rating: 10/10
I think if u see this movie first time, surely you will fall in love with this movie. Excellent work... 👌
This is such a good movie, that even to this day, many years after it came out, I still cannot find a single person who does not like Shawshank redemption.

Everything in this film is timed well. The story is excellent and flows with perfect timing and the editing between the sequences are great. The acting is great, and it keeps you interested from the first to the last frame. It also has a very clever plot. You are not 100% sure what Tim Robbins is up to and how he has escaped until much later.

Great job by everyone from director, actors to script. Just the best in movie making.



Really this film is simply a string of cliches and is mediocre in every way.
How many ways can I list why this is best movie of all time?

1. The most perfect ending of any movie I've ever seen. 2. Best story - Steven King (not even a fan of his) 3. Best acting performance: Morgan Freeman, absolutely

amazing, best ever (Tim Robbins is brilliant also) 4. Best narration - Morgan Freeman's character 5. Most uplifting, touching, moving story ever told. 6. Outstanding soundtrack 7. Beautiful cinematography. 8. Most evil antagonist - The warden 9. Best dialogue - so many memorable phrases and quotes!

I could keep going. I've never encountered a movie that has touched so many people.
Absolutely the most movie overrated i have seen .. There are movies that deserve this rated and have not been talked about.. As for this movie, it is worth watching, but it does not deserve this rating.
I know that other people's votes shouldn't influence mine, either way--but geez, No.2 of all time? What are the IMDb demographics that create that overblown result?

I thought this was a very entertaining movie, somewhere around 8 points. But the script is kind of sugary and the characters lack the subtlety you would expect in a truly great drama. The ending reminded me of The Great Escape.

There are several good performances that aren't quite able to shake loose the limitations of the script and become stirring.

Cute, but not the greatest prison drama ever. I think there must be a lot of teenagers voting on IMDb.

When I first see it, I am too young to understand all the things the movie what to show us. The film gave me a very different feeling. Hope is a dangerous thing, is the root of mental distress. Because since come in the day, the warden said, "the soul to god, the body to me."Except that he can get the cigarettes and naked woman printed CARDS and any other changes I can't seem to grow within the walls of the dark. However Andy told him, "remember, hope is a good thing - and perhaps even good. And no good thing will never disappear." So Andy can use 20 years digging Red think can chisel in tunnel in six hundred.When he finally climbed out of the five hundred yards of the stench of sewage pipes, standing in the pouring rain can't help, we seem to see faith Pierce heavy darkness, played a luminous in the dark of the night out of the blue.Under the light, the soul of our weak under Andy with open arms in the sky in succession, and shaking.
The Story is too complicated Waiting to another season too maybe *Hear broken* .
What is there to say about this movie, except it is a triumph in film making. First of all anything narrated by Morgan Freeman you know is going to be a great movie. A story of a life behind bars with no end, this ordinary man turns Shawshank prison up side down. I think the fact that this movie is so simple is also the reason it is so great. There is no complicated cinematic techniques or special effects, just men talking to each other. Tim Robbins shows us that the good guys can win even when their livelihood has been taken away. Its the kind of movie that just makes you smile on the inside and lets you appreciate the simple things even if just for that day. The Shawshank Redemption is definitely a movie everyone should see, only if just to brighten your day. But I think in the future it will prove to be an important mark in cinematic history.
Awesome movie, Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is a delight from first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done sequence with Andy's (Tim Robbins) trial inter cut with his actions on the night of his crime.

Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who is sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan Freeman's Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen King's short story "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption" (in the film version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the ultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few homosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole. However, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well served by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out amazing, three- dimensional characterizations.
This is a movie to be watched over and over. Each time I get a little bit more out of it. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have a great chemistry together. Many people do not realize that this movie was based on a Stephen King (one of my favorite authors) novel, "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption", especially since it is not of the horror/sci-fi genre. I was really glad to see this one at the top of the list.
I have always loved movies in which to overcome odds, a character must think, and not just use muscle. The Shawshank Redemption is one of, if not, the best example of this!!! I LOVE IT!
Seriously, if ever there's a film that people should be forced to watch, it's this. The acting in it is truly perfect, the storyline in very, very well written and the ending is one of the cleverest (and most misleading) endings I have ever witnessed. This film can (and will) be enjoyed by people of all ages (relatively - check parents guide for suitability), and will keep you in suspense for the full duration. Unlike in most other Hollywood films, the twists in the storyline are very well executed and it is in no ways cheesy or cheap. Morgan Freeman gives the performance of his life without making his fellow actors over-act. The Shawshank Redemption blows every other prison dramas out of the water. See it at all costs.
Well as the other more than 2000 review say it, in my opinion this is the best movie created so far. It basically just how life is: you get punched in a face time to time, but you have to stand up, keep your hope and give value to your fellows, because in return life takes care about your reward. Oh yes, and if you face any evil that you can stop, do it. This is the message of the film, if we follow it, life may be as rewarding ultimately for us as for the hero. Other films that moved me like this: Forrest Gump, The curious case of Benjamin Button. IMDb says I have to write another line in order for them to post my review so here it is xD
Touching, moving, exceptional in every single aspect of it. Grear movie and great actors. It fullfills your expectations completely, I just want to watch more of Morgan Freeman movies right now LOL Touching, moving, exceptional in every single aspect of it. Grear movie and great actors.

'94...the year the greatest movie to exist on this site was created...to bad you movie-goers disagree. Godfather Part I is a classic, but get real you can't defy this movie. It may get slow at points but it overcomes that with amazing cleverness and a few tricks up the director's sleeve. If you see or have seen this movie you will find or know that this movies brings out many surprises.
As I was saying just amazing, it makes you laugh, cry and even shout
This movie is good, there's no question about that, but he 2nd best ever? That's a bit of a stretch. I can't really imagine that all of those people who gave this movie the 9 and 10 votes have seen very many other good movies. Sure, the story is meaningful and it's harsh etc, but there are so many movies that are moving and powerful. The fact that Shawshank is #2 on this list is a reflection of those voting.
Firstly, I cant belive that its been 25 years since its release. The script and direction are faultless, the cast are superb and its just a wonderful watch. I'm not going to spoil any of it but suffice to say if you havn't seen it by now, then please do, you will not be disappointed.
I watched this movie for the umpteenth time probably last Sunday and how much I loved it yet again!!! A movie I would never ever get bored of and definitely, one of my all time favorites. A simple yet wonderful story about HOPE!!! HOPE – One word that drives all of us and gives us reason to live. We push ourselves through our mundane lives in the hope of achieving / finding something that we dream of. In the words of this movie's protagonist – "hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies"!!! Superlative performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.

A must watch if you haven't!!!
An inspirational and warm-hearted movie that almost put me to tears at the end. This is one of those rare movies that gets better and better the more times you watch it. The great lines in this movie just made it that much better. The friendship that was portrayed by the main characters Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were totally convincing. It's such an involving movie that grabbed me from the start, and the great music didn't hurt either. Don't miss this powerful prison drama that shows that "hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things."
We have all see movies, comedies, action and dramas. We all liked ones, hated others, got into some other even and felt like part of it. In Shawshank Redemption; you start slowly, after a while you get attached, by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else! then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics! I felt warm, strong, happy and all other emotions one can think of, I felt I was the one who won, who got out of prison, i was simply fully satisfied.

This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!
This movie is one of those ones that makes you think really deep about life, your life! Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith, in a dark atmosphere.

Believe me when I say this is the best movie I have ever seen.and I have seen anime's,movies but there is nothing like Shawshank redemption.this movie is pure gold.best movie there is and there ever will be.it stars Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Amazing acting by these two.wonderful story and just amazing movie.words are not enough to tell I great this movie is.its just flows with you.
This movie is the best drama movie I have ever seen in my whole life, it is honestly worth watching.

This bloated and soggy piece of work is so far from earning a number 2 spot on the IMDb that I have to imagine that Stephen King has bought votes for it. Trite , mawkish, shallow, unconvincing, ugly... How much more can I say about its awfulness? Morgan Freeman is tolerable, Tim Robbins is not. There is a romantic glow to the cinematography that is really inappropriate if the main characters are heterosexual. If they aren't there is an unexplored subtext poisoning the base of the movie. There is nothing else about this movie that makes a lick of sense: emotional, dramatic, logical, racial, penological. Rips off the Count of Monte Cristo and Huckleberry Finn and cheapens and flattens them. Its appeal escapes me utterly. For the love of God, sink this film!

This movie is probably my number one movie of all time. Everytime I watch it, I feel like I'm watching it for the first time again. This movie shows friendship, determination, and hope (the main theme of this movie). I could go on and on about how amazing this movie is, but I encourage you to see it for yourself and the beauty of it. You won't regret, definitely buy it!
It gets better the original story of Sthepen King. Amazing adaptation.

I would recommend this to anyone! Easy watch, although it might feel lengthy for some.
One of the best films of its type, only bettered by Frank Darabont's other period prison drama based on a Stephen King story "The Green Mile". Mr Darabont and Mr King appear to have hit on the perfect partnership, in making fantastic films based in prisons and set in days gone by. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are both excellent in this movie, although Mr Freeman is always excellent (especially in his high school drama "Lean on me"). Well done to all concerned in this excellent production, and let's hope that Mr Darabont and Mr King continue in this successful vein for the future
This title has to be one of the greatest films ever made. It is a touching story of a man who is sent to prison for life for the accused murdering of his wife and her lover. The story is so captivating and completely differs from other prison films because of its heart.

A defiant masterpiece which makes you enthralled within it from the very beginning. Brilliantly acted by Tim Robbins and, of course, Morgan Freeman as always. Brilliantly directed, scripted and the original score was very, very good.

I have watched it three times in the last year and I still can't get enough of it. A defiant worth wile watch.
O.K. you've seen the summary and you're screaming "What kind of sour limey b@!*&%$£ says that about one of the greatest films ever made?" Well I've got news for you, look again. The Shawshank Redemption is a very good movie, i agree but is it all it's cracked up to be? - no. At first you think "I feel great - what a feel-good movie!" One can't help wondering that this film, on closer inspection, is actually unbelievably cheesy. Every other second i was hearing violins about how this poor guy got landed in jail for a murder he didn't commit. It's stereotypical - and you guys who voted 10 bought it hook, line and sinker. "But what about the great twist?" O.k., the twist was good but come on...like i said before was it THAT great? Ask yourselves honestly, was that better than The Sixth Sense's or The Usual Suspects? Also, how come foreign films which are far superior to this get no credit? Watch Le Samurai, or La Haine or Todo Sobre Mi Madre. Far more superior.

Shawshank redemption is one of the greatest classic movie ever watched by most. If you are Hollywood fan, you must watch this. Because if you skipped this, you will be missed greatest movie experience.
This is the best emotional roller coaster you could ever watch
What I can say is this is a really great movie. It tells use there exists brightness in the darkness and never gives up hope. You will succeed in the end. And also be ready at any time.

Maybe it is because of language problem, I don't grasp it very well in the beginning. But step by step, I understand it. And in the end, I understand it and especially the result is out of my expectation that doesn't happened in the movies I have ever seen in the past.

And also the performance skill is another thing I like it. They are good actors. And this is the movies that seldom take man-women sensation as topic, but still give people good feelings.

Great movie encourage you while entertaining you!
It is a beautiful film witha a good intention. The celebration of friendship, celebration of life are the key points. Top notch acting and direction. It is a great piece of art.
The movie had plot up the wazoo! The acting was superb. Robbins and Freeman were at their highest in this movie. There were so many emotions flying through it and there was so much about the human mind. It will leave you in awe.
I just visited a prison museum in north China, which was a real prison used in early 1900s. This movie reminds me of horrible dark room, sodomy, and brutal corporal punishment that actually can happen to you in the jail.

Whether you are innocent or not, once you are IN the jail. You are all the same. Your are finished. But, Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) is not. With hope and his persistence, he escaped from jail after 20 years. Imagine to dig a big cement hole with the small stone hatchet! Amazing.

Where there is a will, there is a way. This movie is encouraging.
There are a very few movies that make you think ,think about the things that are important in life, things that truly matter and The Shawshank Redemption is surely one of those movies. It teaches you that life will put you in situations which you must not have imagined yourself to be in ever and how you can survive those situations. You will learn something new every time you watch it.

The Shawshank has one of the greatest messages of all time. Hope. Hope is the idea of believing in yourself or others. It helps you get motivated and helps you persevere. You see Andy dufrine getting wrongly accused and going to prison there he meets his mates and learns each and every one of them he studies the people the ward. at the end a miracle happens I'll try not spoil it. Overall I've seening this movie as a 13 year old really helps your mind. Too many teenagers are being depressed every single day. I want to tell them hey see this movie it will help you. Oh well no one likes my movie taste.
It's really amazing movie but it doesnt deserve to be on the top of the list

This movie is the greatest movie ever made and has the greatest actors ever Iike Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and this movie has everything it has friendship hope sadness and a twist ending whoever says they don't like this movie should never watch another movie again.
After watching this movie i was stunned at how great it was. It was the first movie that kept me hooked the whole way through and had everything in it. What made it better was seeing how it was expanded so well from the original short story, which again was very good. How anyone can say it less, must not have been watching it properly. There is nothing to say to criticise the movie, the acting was brilliant, the casting great, and the directing, breath taking. But we can not overlook the great writer who brought this story to life, Steven King. Without having writers like him, we would never have any movies to match up to the likes of Shawshank and Godfather. I am still waiting for another movie to knock it off the top of my top 10 list, however, i am doubtful if this will ever happen.
I cant believe that something so simply good exists. This is by far the best thing i have ever watched on my TV. I loved every piece of it and i'm gonna watch it once a year till my time on this world is over. I can't describe the feeling and joy you will have after watching it, because i can't find the right words to describe it. Watch it and you will see what i mean. The first time is always the best. It's the time when it will leave you speechless for a couple of seconds. And after those seconds you will begin to understand that you just watched a masterpiece. What i liked the most is the big time span in which the movie plays. All those years in one place and the dependence for some people after you leave it.

I am so pleased to see the high rating this movie has received. Many people I know have never heard of it, but when I tell them about it and they rent it, they are 'converted'!! Compared to so many recent movies that are eye-candy, this film delivers the true meaning of friendship and focuses on this aspect instead of flasy cars, lasers, dumb plots and high paid actors bloated with self confidence.

Another movie along the same line is "Spitfire Grill". Rent it and you will probably enjoy it as much.
I really like this movie. It was very well done and the screen play was great. Totally awesome plot and the best acting I have ever saw. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was a movie to die for. You could tell that they put time and efffort into making this masterpiece.
Stephen King was surely pleased to see one of his works faithfully represented on-screen. The director does an excellent job of showing the bleakness of prison life, the frustration of a life gone awry, and the misery of losing all one holds dear in life, while somehow preserving the hope of better things to come. Every actor was perfectly cast and the story-line draws to a perfect and satisfying close. If you enjoyed the film, you'll love the book from whence it came; "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption".
"I have been thinking for a while to watch " Shawshank Redemption"(1993) the number one movie on IMDb list 9.2/10,finally did it, its a excellent example of good story telling ,one of the story that makes u think and touches your soul, this movie is all about hope ,hope in bad times & not letting it go whatever is the situation ,hope that one day u will have your laugh,hope to be loved again,hope to achieve something big,hope to breath free. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins)not only was hopeful for himself in the his bad time but made his prison mates hopeful by providing them feel of freedom through books and music,he also gave his best prison mate Red (Morgan Freeman) reason to live once he made it out from the prison. and as Tim Robbins says "hope is one of the good things and good things never dies".
The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic masterpiece. Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. Andy Defrain escapes from prison by digging a hole in the wall that is hidden under the poster of the model. Warden and Brookes commit suicide and Baron gets sent to jail. Lastly, morgan freemans character is set free.
This film ranks second among my all time favourites. The only reason it does not hold that coveted first place spot is that I am obsessed with Monty Python's "The Holy Grail". Shawshank is a beautifully crafted film, with one of the best endings I have ever seen; even though in a way it is not entirely unexpected. It is particularly enlivened by the presence of Morgan Freeman, who should have won an Oscar for his voice-overs alone. In a word, Exceptional.
No matter what it is, hope cannot be closed. Everything is caused by hope. Is it because of the inner hope that countless hard work, hard work, and unrelenting returns? With hope, Shawshank Prison is nothing but a hope. With a hope, a small hammer can redeem life, redeem freedom, and even Shark Castle (Shawshank Prison).
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
We watch this when its on tv but i notice where they take out certain words so if you see it watch it on dvd! This is one of those movies that make you feel like you live with the characters and that's why the end is so redeeming to watch.
I use this movie in my Interpersonal Communication course. The relationship between Red and Andy provides rich examples for my students to look for as they write on important issues of Interpersonal Communication such as the symbolic nature of language, powerful and powerless speech, posture, intimate and social distances, territory, chronemics, various types of listening, and self disclosure. Many "young" students struggle to relate "in-class/in-text" examples to their own lives, and I use this movie to give the class a common experience to discuss and better understand the foundational elements of Interpersonal Communication. ALWAYS a good experience for my students!
Don't even bother reading any reviews this movie needs no introduction. Watch it and then regret it because no movie will EVER come close to how exquisite shawshank is. Please show this to the next generation when appropriate as its truly groundbreaking. (Or should I say wall...)
This movie is the perfect balance of class, beautiful directing and feel-good ending.
Don't get me wrong - I liked this movie just fine, I just don't understand how it deserves the *heaps* of rapturous praise it regularly receives from IMDb members, and the fact that is has been ranked at #2 in the hallowed IMDb Top 250 for the past 8 years or so just baffles me. It was certainly entertaining enough, and very well-acted, but also way over-long, and filled with the usual stock characters that seem to inhabit every prison drama (if Hollywood movies are to be believed, prison wardens are mainly just nasty SOB's and the inmates are just the best bunch of guys you'd ever want to meet). I'd recommend the movie as a good renter, but I guess I can't see it as any more than that. I realize I am way in the minority on this, however.

Many reviews talk about how they don't have words that can describe this movie. I have the perfect word: vanilla This movie is the Toyota Camry of movies. Pleasant, but bland. It doesn't take any risks, just plays it safe and the result is a pleasant experience, but not a satisfying one. I would have liked to see more risks taken. How about some ground-breaking cinematography? What if some of the characters pushed the envelope a little further? Far enough to be accused of overacting by some? How about a parallel story? How about SEVERAL parallel stories? What about moving the story at a faster pace? The beginning of the movie was really quite slow...There is no reason this movie should be more than 2 hours. I give it only a 7 out of 10 for breaking no new ground. I think this movie fails to distinguish itself in my memory.


Sure it was a good prison movie, and much better than many other movies I've seen. But this does NOT beat Godfather, Star Wars, or Casablanca in any way. Watch this if you enjoy good performances and good plot, but don't expect a present-day classic ala Forrest Gump.
Just watch it....one of the finest movie ever made.
Trust me this one of the movie that u must be watched before dead. I really love the story. Thanks for stephen king!!! Good acting too. Everything about this movie so good. In fact from me this rating movie should be 9,8 :)
I won't repeat the ravings by others about this Movie (yes, that's a capitalized M!) I'll just share with you my experience watching it on CNN last month. I'm a graduate student, and midterm week was approaching. I constantly said to myself: Ok, I'll go to the library at the next commercial break ... but without me knowing it my butt was glued to the seat after the first 5 minutes... and by and by I forgot I was watching a film. Finally when it was over I was left tearful and speechless. It was that powerful an experience. I even feel that my life is enriched so much more after watching the film. Those 3 hours are worth every second of it, I can tell you that!
Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as "The Movie". When I say "The Movie", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those "Budget Theaters" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said "That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every
It's just perfect movie.

Subject, details, and engagement.

Describes the struggle of a human being a character who confronts injustice.
One of the most creative and satisfying cinematic endings. I don't know anyone who was not touched by this movie.

The story of two men, Andy Dufresne and Red, takes place inside the confined prison walls. Their growing friendship develops into a close bond.

With the desparation of prison life, the story takes a turn for the better at the end.
"The Shawshank Redemption" has so much skill which went into the production that it is regrettable that it's overlength undermines its attributes. Episodic, slack and slow formatting stretch the narrative far beyond what its material requires. The result is a fair film, with some worthy touches.
For once a movie that features a story we want to follow, character development, marvelous acting and an ending that is original and empowering.

This film deserves all the accolades.

How soon will Hollywood be shooting the gender switch version (LMFAO!!!)?

This is the kind of bad that I'll still watch after 30 years.

This is a fantastic film. It's well-crafted, the acting is excellent, and the cast members are endearing (or, in the case of the pigs, repulsive).
This, for me, is film at it's best. The acting, (Tim Robbins, in particular, is amazing. Morgan Freeman is his usual wonderful self also.) the screenplay, the production, the...well, all of it! I could rave about it until I'm blue in the face, but I'll spare you (and myself) that.

I must have watched it over a dozen times now, and with every viewing I still get as caught up in it as I did the first time I saw it. For me, that's one of the marks of a special film. I'm don't really want to use the term 'uplifting' yet again, but it is the best way to describe it.

Highly recommended.
Bill's and Morgan's brilliant performances coupled with an immersive scenario and production makes this movie one of the all time legends.
The only thing that amazes me about this movie is that it is not only within 500 top movies in IMDB but actually #2 and soon perhaps #1...

I only saw Shawshank Redemption once, and have not been able to force myself to watch it in full length ever since. It was ok to see it once even though I was almost bored then, but not quite. I found it very average in every respect, and quite predictable. I guess that this is one of those movies that is so average that it does not bother anybody by invoking powerful emotions, thoughts or memories, and does not have any obviously bad technical quality. Just sooo average. Hence the high score?
Very few movies that made me cry ... and (The Shawshank Redemption) is certainly one of them. I remember when I first went to see this movie in my freshman year in college. The movie made me appreciate freedom and true friendship.

Very powerful picture indeed and each actor deserved an Oscar for their great performance. It is sad that the movie did not get the true scale of recognition it deserved, but being on the IMDb top 250 movies of all time based on people's votes is a great way to show the well earned appreciation.

If you did not watch this movie yet, then you missed a lot!

The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that will really never ever be forgotten. Arguably the best movie of all time. A thundering reassurance in the hope for a better tomorrow, this movie is truly an epitome of hope and perseverance. Probably should be filed under the category of movies you should watch anyhow before you die. True masterpiece. There won't be another movie that can be quite anything like this.

This movie is so powerful that I can't even describe this in a few words. This is the kind of movie that rekindles hopes in all of us. The kind of movie that will always keep moving and impressing generations to come. With a storyline that not only will blow you away, but also strengthen your hopes and faith in the fact that "Hope is a good thing. Maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies".
Good cast. Good story. The performances were excellent and there was both ample food for thought, and some very good scenes. Didn't hurt that i'm a big Morgan Freeman fan. Always top notch.

On the other hand, overall, the whole film was far too unpleasant, preachy, and downright repugnant, to be terribly enjoyable. When the payoff at the end finally arrived, it just wasn't grand enough to overcome the feeling i'd just crawled through the sewer.

And for this to be the #1 film on IMDb (actually second, but same score as #1 and with more votes) among far superior films like "The Godfather", "Schindler's List", "Lord of the Rings", and "Casablanca", is ludicrous. This would never even have entered the remotest regions of my mind if somebody had asked me to name some really great films.
If there's one surefire movie every person can agree on, it's the shawshank redemption. while it was originally a novel, it evolved into what the IMDb considers the best movie of all time, ranking #1 in the IMDb top 250.

Young man Andy Dufresne is framed and cast into Shawshank Prison, The 2nd worst prison in all of America (number one being Alcatraz) While being in the prison, he's sexually molested by insane inmates, Beat up by Heartless and immoral guards, and his experience as a banker taken advantage of by the warden. But through it all, Andy manages to keep hope through a fear that keeps all of his fellow inmates Prisoners.

All i can say is, Watch this film.

10/10

This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you...
I've seen this film many times before , and every time I watch it it just seems to get better! There really is nothing bad I have to say about this film , because the overlying message of the film is infinite , and it's just such a timeless classic . I can't imagine the movie without Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in their respective roles so bravo to them , because ultimately these two characters are the heart of the story. While there are some scenes that truly stand out to me , you just need to do yourself a favour a watch this amazing film. It's one of the best of all time and I can promise you that you will enjoy it !

There is no reason for this movie to be above Citizen Kane, Godfather 2, etc. It is a good enjoyable movie yes. But it is also cheesy at times and a little bit pretentious. I believe what works for this movie is that it has a sort of "everyman" charm to it. It is a movie that an entire family can sit and watch and enjoy. Yet, if one digs deeper into it, those that know movies should be able to see its weaknesses. Its dialogue for one is not very strong. The performances are solid, but I believe I have seen Morgan Freeman do this role better many times before. Is this a better prison movie than say... "Murder in the First"? Probably, but is it sooo much better that this film deserves to be number 2 all time. THink about that... the second best film EVER. Somehow I doubt that.
Acted out perfectly by every cast member, under the watchful eye of Frank Darabont, the story of a man who brings hope to the grey walls of Shawshank prison becomes so much more than a prison movie. The first time I ever saw "The Shawshank Redemption", I knew nothing about it, and was utterly unprepared for it's effect. Within the first ten minutes, I was utterly drawn in, unable to pull my eyes away from the screen. By the end of the first hour, I couldn't even think about pausing or stopping this film. I spent the last fifteen minutes crying my eyes out at the sheer emotion in those minutes. Morgan Freeman out-does his every role previous and every role since as Red, while Tim Robbins, quiet and intense, leads the cast as Andy. This film been regarded for more than fifteen years as one of the greatest to ever emerge from cinema. It is a story of corruption, and of justice. A story of imprisonment and of freedom. A story of despair and of hope. More even, than all of that, "Shawshank" is a story of humanity, and one that will stay with whomever watches it for a very, very, long time.
When I watched Shawshank Redemption at first,I had been in the high school and this film left a good impression with me, I say that I learned how to follow your passions and hopes, how to struggle to be free. And " don't never forget,hope is good something and good somethings never die " this sentence which passes in the film, I always believe it every part of mine. Because A person lives with his or her hopes and passions so, If it is seized from people,that people lose their aims in the life. And what the best properties of this film, It shows that hopes and passions are indispensable for people...In addition to my review about Shawshank Redemption, Whenever I watch this film, I learn that it puts in new things my life. It is so important for every watcher, Shawshank Redemption should be watched and I advise it to you :)
this film is simply brilliant. the characters are all totally awesome and so are the actors who play them! also when watching this amazing film, you don't think to pick up on the little things until it all becomes clear! it truly is one of the best films that i have ever seen along side requiem for a dream and the lord of the rings trilogy. it is that good that when watching it, you forget that it is a film because you get so into the story and so in love with all of the characters. the men/women who wrote the script for this outstanding movie sensation is exceeding talented, as are all of the people involved in this production and they should all be proud of themselves for producing one of the top three greatest films of all time.
The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies I have seen in sometime. The first time I saw it was in my Film & Literature class and I loved it from start to finish. It keeps you thinking and even if you read the novella, there is changes to it. There are many foreshadowing in it that could help you figure out what's happening later in the story and overall. Many film fans should check it out and even later buy it if you want. The film also has many likable characters as well and you'll have some of those funny moments (but not a lot). It's a movie that you'll watch again and again.

Stars: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Mark Rolston. Year: 1994
After reading all the rave reviews for this movie, it turned out to be a real disappointment. Can anyone really believe that the prisoners are honourable men while the guards and warden are all "crooks"?? Haven't we overdone the hypocritical "Bible thumper"?? -- let's find a more enlightened characterization. James Bond, himself, could not have followed the main character's escape plan. The ending soliloquy and denouement were inferior plagiarisms from "Cool Hand Luke". Enough!!! Unfortunately, fine performances by both Robbins and Freeman were wasted in this "fantasy" story.

I don't dislike this movie, I think it's fine. Certainly it's not number 1, not even top 100. The movie becomes pretty stale mid way through and let's be honest there's absolutely nothing original about it.

What I dislike most about this movie is the typically boring people who say it's their favourite for no other reason other than it's what they think people want to hear. Thus making them appear less boring.

1 star because it needs knocking down a peg or 5.
In these times, where an "Every man for himself" mentality prevails and one's self worth is measured by possessions, this movie reminds us that the escalating fear that we all have, as this country spirals out of control, is best abated by having someone you can call a true friend.

As time passes and, more of us see that this country is heading inexorably toward social, political and economic disaster, this movie will find an even larger audience of devotees. Perhaps, one day, we will abandon our materialism and discover that true hope which we will desperately need and, a major theme of this movie, lies in our relationships with others. Until then, we will have the Shawshank Redemption to remind us what real friendship looks like.
Not for a reason. But for the fine art to create a story who seems be more than fiction and who use a script, a cast and location for a puzzle who becomes part of precious memories. Its themes, the tension, the moral questions, the meeting between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and the result of dialogs who are truth axis of movie and wise adaptation, are bones of a splendid film. A film who reminds more than presents. Values, roots of justice, beauty of original source, the end who is expression of a deep expectation of the viewer are elements who transforms The Shawshank Redemption in an experience for the viewer. Short - a film who must see!
This is an outstanding movie from beginning to end. The cast was picked with excellence and the characters were made so that the audience would care about them. Even though the middle of the story was a bit slow, it began to drag when it started building up the plot for the climax in the middle. Stephen King does not usually write novels as a drama and when he does do it, it is critically acclaimed. It is amazing how much though was put into making this story, with the back tracking to reveal major plot points and how this happened. Morgan Freeman's narration is excellent in this movie too, his character is one you won't forget because of how strong his performance is. Over all this is a fantastic movie. If you haven't see this yet I recommend you do, this movie is one you won't want to forget.
Is there anyone who does not like this film? If there is, I've never met them. "The Shawshank Redemption" is a film that doesn't sound too interesting when you first hear about it. A banker who protests his innocence after his wife and her lover are killed befriends a group of prisoners and changes everyone's life for the better. It does not sound that great to most people, but when you see this film you will honestly come away loving every frame of it. Tim Robbins is great, Morgan Freeman is greater, and the supporting cast are all perfect. William Sadler, Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, and Gil Bellows stand out as well. James Whitmore, who has been in acting since the 1940s, gives his best performance as Brooks and should have at least received an Oscar nod. If you haven't seen this film go and see it. I can't think of any movie I'd rather watch on a rainy afternoon, or at anytime for that matter. Frank Darabont, who had been involved in horror films before this, became a big-time name after this film. Unfortunately, "The Green Mile" is nowhere close to comparing to this film which will be remembered forever. A great achievement. 5 stars out of 5.
Worth every minute of it! I didn't expect much from it but Freeman's narration got me hooked quick. The portrayal of friendship is on another level..then it finishes with a powerful punch!
The first time I watched this movie I was immersed in a prison world where survival is on the daily schedule and hope means everything. I was literally breathless for 2 hours. I just cannot believe how this movie was so undervalued when initially released. This is hands down the best movie I have ever seen. This is one movie where the ending does not really matter. It is the journey that will keep you on the edge of your seat and you will wish it never ends.
This is the worlds best movie. Never seen any other beautifull movie than this one. Best acting and story. Must watch movie
This film is hard, exciting, realistic, beautiful and surprising. The Shawshank Redemption completely absorbs you and constantly throws you back and forth between joy and sadness. It simply blew me away, and if it was possible, I would give it 11 without thinking twice.
This is one of the best films I have ever seen in my seventeen years. The movie is highly underrated by film critics, but if you look at imdb's top 250 films you will see it is rated #1. Tim Robbins gives his best performance, he plays a prisoner who is serving time for a crime he didn't commit. I guarantee you, you will enjoy this movie. Check out my other reviews!
The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that you shouldn't miss. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those niche films that only begins to shine after it has crept into your subconsciousness. Although it is a long film, you don't even notice the time passing as you become absorbed by the plot-line and twists therein. It's more than a good film - it's a great film!
Just watch it! if u watch this movie you r gonna get really strong lesson for this life ..
Its literally my favorite movie. I can watch it over and over again. The acting is of course amazing. Ah I simply can't put in words how I feel about this movie. I LOVE IT! In my opinion its a must watch movie! I totally recommend it.

Oh Did I say that I LOVE IT!? Well.... I LOVE IT!!!
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
Ten Thumbs Up if I had them. Incredible story, incredible cast. I would rate this as probably the best film I have ever seen and I have probably seen it a hundred times on cable. I would have to say this would be Morgan Freemans best performance out of all of his films. There should have been an Oscar for him. This film definitely beat out "Million Dollar Baby" for which he ultimately and finally received his first Oscar. The Academy wasn't all there when "Shawshank" deserved its due. Robbins played a great part in this film and did an excellent job however Freeman carried the film. A true drama that shows the bond of two people in horrible circumstances. Yes, this one is one to own, if you don't have it...buy it. You wont be disappointed.
For the life of me, I can't understand all the gushing about this cornball, sentimental and PHONY movie. There are certainly some strong performances, but they're outweighed by some of the two-dimensional portrayals, weak writing (that opera sequence -- oh, please) and most of all a completely garbage ending (I won't give it away) that stomps on what little credibility the movie has.

I guess you really can't go broke under-estimating people's intelligence.
He's very smart and figures out a lot through the years he's in prison. I'm 12 but I think it's amazing and I definitely think if any parents read this, you should let your kids watch it. There is some suicidal content so I recommend you fast forward through those parts (that part.) 10/10 Recommend 10 and older

I cant understand why this movie got such a high rating. its a good movie but there are lots of others that deserve to be number 2 in the "best of all time list" (american beauty, pulp fiction, Chaplin's, Buñuel's or Kubrick's movies, just to name a few). Well..I'm an old Stephen King fan and the story of "Redemtion" is good and thrilling and the acting and photography is good as well but its nothing that has'nt been made before. don't get me wrong i liked it but i think its just a well made entertaining picture and nothing more.

So watch it and have a good time but don't expect an artistically great work or something all too original.
This was a very good movie. Robbins and Freeman are Terrific. It was a very moving movie. I would strongly recommend this movie.
The best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. This will be a movie that will live on through history.
Absolutely incredible. This movie is a masterpiece and i will keep on watching it till the end of time.
These two did an amazing job together. You don't see this type of story telling between two actors in modern-day movies, let alone an amazing story at this level.
I loved this movie! Beautifully filmed, the story is told as if time does not matter. No plot that has to be rushed through, no fast cars or anything. Just a very good story by Stephen King, marvellous actors and a lot of exciting emotions. It made me feel good to watch a man who keeps his hope for so many years.

The scene with the Mozart-record broke my heart!
The story line is beautiful and the casting expertly done. It one of those movies that you take so much from it that you get to criticize or judge other movies quality and casting based on movies like this one.


Let's be honest, it's a fairly mediocre movie. Entertaining, I'll grant you, but profound? No way. Not much here in terms of innovative or even creative film-making either.

Is it one of the most popular films of all time? Probably. At least of recent time. Is it the greatest film ever made? Don't make me laugh.

That said, I'm glad people can enjoy this movie. I won't watch it again, but I don't exactly regret it.
The movie is just excellent, I really liked the plot of the movie and Akshay Kumar's acting. I'm sure it will be a success, the sensational movie. Super Top!! I recommend!!
If you are looking for a story that is entertaining and just when you think you know the end you realize that this is not the case, this is the right movie, the dialogues are enveloping, the characters complex and immigrant and the relationship between them is intelligent and well managed.
When I saw the rating I couldn't believe it. This is indeed great for kids and parents to watch. Morale is spectacular and the actors are awesome. The best part is it is about the environment and classic cinema would approve. Watch it with your kids and tell me it's not worth it. Loved it and so did my kids!


Best movie ever? Not even close. This is good movie, but there are 1000 good movies. Very few Great movies, and this certainly isn't great.

Like others have pointed out, way overrated.

Don't need to review it, as so many have already done. But I wanted to add another voice to the small group of people that acknowledge that it is getting way too much praise.

This doesn't even come close to both Godfather films.
having this movie in your top ten best films of all time is like saying the greatest pieces of art ever painted are the ones they put on hotel walls. Maybe this is true in a sort of egalitarian, democratic and mind-numbingly banal way. A thoroughly ordinary film, that has been embraced by men who want to cry, have faith, and have equilibrium. Which is nice.
'The Shawshank Redemption (1994)' is easily one of my favourite films of all time (top three material, for sure). It is a true classic that holds the honour of being the highest rated film on IMDb (with a 9.3/10) for good reason. Some scenes will make you laugh, some scenes will make you cry and some scenes will make you do both all at the same time. Each moment will keep you thoroughly entertained and riveted to your seat throughout. It's thanks to well-developed characters and a deeply-effecting story, one that deals with timeless and powerful themes of hope, that this remains such a seminal piece of work. A true masterpiece. 10/10
One of the best films I've ever seen you just have to see it for yourself and you will know why, However if you're a big Sly or Arnold fan, you may not like it as it doesn't have any exploding cars, plus it has a lot of dialogue and some words with more than two syllables
Based on the King short story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption', this Frank Darabont masterpiece has etched itself in the minds of viewers ever since its release as one of the most beloved films of all time. In the beginning of the short story, its alternative title is revealed to us: 'Hope Springs Eternal'. This in essence is the message that the film is trying to convey to the audience, and what a wonderful way it is revealed!
What A Movie..Excelled In Every Aspect..Right From Start To Finish You Will Love How The Movie Goes On..Makes You Cry, Laugh, Anxiety,Tension..Etc.. Each And Every Expression You Can Feel On Your Face. Each And Every Aspect Of The Of The Movie Is Good. Tim Robbins And Morgan Freeman TAKE A BOW. Bob Gun ton IS Also Excellent In His Role. James Whit more Also Gave a Great Performance

The Way Frank Directed The Movie Is AMAZING. He Kept This Movie At a Great Steady Pace Along With The Writing And Great Cinematography.

Each And Every Cast And Crew Did An Excellent Job..

Do Yourself A Favor Go Watch The Movie.
This is a story that keeps on giving right to the end and it is delivered by Robbins and Freeman.

Considering the movie takes place in a prison or perhaps because it does, it is an incredibly uplifting tale of hope, survival and a never give up attitude.

The story as great as it is does come second to the performances of the 2 leads. They create a connection between each other and then the audience that entices you in and holds you close as a viewer.

If Shawshank does one thing it makes you wish that more movies could be made like it.
this movie is all about that great story King wrote, that with great cinematic expression, great acting, great sub plots, this is a movie you can see many and many times in your life and every single time you see it, it will deliver emotional good feelings...

Andy Dufresne's expression on his face through out the whole movie is incredible, the very old guy with the bird, he's just perfect, i feel like he's my grandpa or something, you just can't help to not love him, his character is the one that really got me emotional... Morgan Freeman is great like in all his films, you just can't think of a better casting... i love this film

i'm not quite sure if it deserves to be #1 on the top 250 IMDb list, but well, you decide... hope you love it as much as i do !
This is a great movie. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It is kind of scary at time. It is a great movie. See it. It is one of the best movies ever. There no reason not to like movie. It is a great movie.

I guess the title of the review speaks for itself so just watch it you'll enjoy it.
Just another review on how good this movie is. The development of the "mystery-scam" was amazing and the plot twists the best in all film land. Performances on point, clever script and well executed story. A must see!!
To be brief, as a man who has watched thousands of movies in my life, Shawshank redemption is the best movie I have ever seen. The plot, the way it develops, the acting, the portrayal of every human emotion, and the ending makes 99% of movies seem like just a waste of time. I didn't see it until a few years after it came out. My sister said it was a great movie. It was on HBO, so I watched it. I was speechless. I have always found it strange that it was from a Steven King novel. I've read a few (not that one) and what comes through in the movie doesn't seem like anything that would be in a Steven King novel. A better movie may come along but it may be a while.
"The Shawshank Redemption" is a very emotional movie. It takes its time telling its story but it doesn't feel long. It is a great looking movie with a terrific cast. The cast all deliver top-notch performances, especially Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. The last forty minutes of "The Shawshank Redemption" are classic. Writer/director Frank Darabont does a great job mixing violence, cruelty and humanity into a very satisfying watch.
10 stars is to little for this film its one of the best of all time and it deserves every praise it have
The Shawshank Redemption is actually a short novel written by Stephen King. Tim Robbins is falsely imprisoned for the murder of his wife. He becomes best friends with Morgan Freeman and plots an escape using a small hammer to slowly create an opening in the wall which is covered with posters.

Freeman narrates the story and he and Robbins make a terrific pair struggling to survive prison life while keeping their sanity. They manage to make it through their days by dreaming of the perfect escape. King has written a tale of hope and inspiration which is adapted with great style and grace by Frank Darabont. He later made King's Green Mile in 1999, another excellent prison drama.


If you want to see hope in its most poetic and dramatic sense, choose The Shawshank Redemption. I commend it to everyone who thinks movies are more than source of 'entertainment',that they are mirrors of life and its moral lessons. I cannot find any other movie with such compelling touch of hope, faith and love. You will understand what redemption is, you will understand what a Fountain of Hope can do, if we let it reign inside of us.

From the production, to the timing, to the script, and the acting of each character, The Shawshank Redemption gave justice to its box-office title. It may have not won Best Picture but for me, it is the Best Picture by far.



A man is sent to prison and has to learn to adapt to prison life,, there he meets a wise old gentleman who he befriends, and there friendship grows immensely. along the way he meets different prison characters, all of which are very likable... adapted from a short short by Steven King,, this is a powerful movie,, showing prison life in the early 20 th century. Tim Robbins was wonderful in this and should have won an award,, Morgan freeman is captivating in his role as "Red" , Our main character, Andy Dufrene plans a prison break and needs the help of several of the inmates.. I wont' say what happens after his attempted prison break,, but this is a touching movie, with a lot of character development, and not much on the action,, but it really doesn't need to have a lot of action,, lot's of humor abound, a movie about growing up in person, and the people that you might, and the life struggles of being in prison,, excellent movie.. but not the greatest of all time,,, I can think of at least 10 better .
One of my all time favorites.It is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising "twist" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.

I have three framed posters of my favourite films on my wall. On the left is 'The Dark Knight' and on the right is 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'. These are the best films of their outstanding trilogies and, in my opinion, are the greatest films of my generation. I have watched each countless times because they're filled with action, suspense and tension and also incorporate a sense of overcoming that which seems impossible to overcome.

Then, purely because it was rated highly, I watch a film not of my generation, on a free DVD from the Sunday Times. Without special effects or a large budget, The Shawshank Redemption became my third poster because it exceeds the qualities TDK and ROTK have in abundance.

Each are excellent. Shawshank's better.

This is by far and away one of the best Hollywood films made in a generation. The drama was compelling, the acting was admirable and complimented the story to perfection. The writing was exquisite and placed a balance on leading dialogue and narration. This is a great example of what film making is all about. It doesn't rely heavily on "movie magic," but instead uses camera movement, framing and acting as equal tools in delivering an amazing story to audiences.
This movie... is overrated. It's a great movie, don't get me wrong, but it is NOT the greatest movie ever made. Still, definitely worth a watch.

Well now I've finally seen it, and I have to say after the tremendous build up from everyone I've spoken to (IMDB No.2!) etc.. I thought it was ..... OK. I think I would have scored it higher if I'd seen it five years ago but now without nostalgic hindsight it's only a 7!! Shock.. This film is still well worth seeing but the characters are not as well crafted as in 'The Green Mile' nor do they command your compassion (Brooks excepted).

I suppose I'd better see 'Hannibal' SOON!
I saw it a lot of times and I am ready to watch it again everytime. Great actors playing extremly fitting roles and a great story make this movie a go to movie for everyone.
Perfectly fine yarn, but those who are ranking it among the all-time greatest movies need to see some more flicks. The cliches are pretty heavy at times, and the moral of the story seems to be freedom _isn't_ a mental state, after all.
This has got to be one of my favourite films of all time. I first saw it when it made it to British TV and have only just got round to buying it and i've watched it a few times since then.

The characters have so much depth, you end up loving them the more you watch this film. The acting is first class. The cinematography is first class. The sound is first class. The casting is first class. The dialogue is fantastic. All these elements and more make this a riveting watch and you end up wishing the film could be longer.

This is one of the few times i've seen a film after reading the book thinking the film is an improvement. It seems to me it expands a little on Stephen King's novella.

This film deserves the rating it has here on IMDb


When I seen this movie in Top250, I could not believe it, thought it was a joke. It is probably some boring old movie, maybe even without colors. But I was amazed. Similar to Prison Break series, just older version of it. Adventure, Lesson, Inspiration, Motivation, Insight, Experience, Confidence, Emotions...all in one. Good ending too. It lacks nothing. It teaches us to fight for freedom, and not just ordinary freedom like from prisons or psych wards, but freedom from people, diseases, poor life, anything negative or bad. It gives insight into feeling of being released from some institution for those who have not experienced it.
This movie has been rated number one by IMDb for a reason. Why? What's not to like? It has everything. Crime, drama, romance, some comedy. The writers were very well set on what they wanted. They achieved it. One can watch this movie over and over. Every time I watch, I notice something new that I had not noticed before. This movie is very well written. This movie is very well produced. This movie is very well acted. This movie was very well financed. They did not need to use too much money to produce it however, one would never know. Yes. It's that good. This is definitely a movie that belongs on your shelf or in your movie collection. It's rated number one for a reason. Anyone who rates this below an eight, doesn't really know what a good movie is about. The way it's written, directed, acted, financed, produced and acted. If I had three thumbs, the would all be up. So, three thumbs up. If you've never seen this fantasias film, you're missing out. It's a must have. Enjoy.

Despite its status as a classic, The Shawshank Redemption is not quite a great film, argues Robbie Collin.
"The Shawshank Redemption is a truly solid film with a touching story, dark, sad, brutal, depressing, and inspiring, terrific perfomance by all the cast and incredible story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is not only tells a story about a man in prison but also tells a story about a man with a great lesson that we as an audience can take and learn, overall The Shawshank Redemption is simply one of the greatest film i've ever watch, i highly recommended"
the Shawshank redemption should be played throughout the world in all schools to teach people the hard life of prison but the bond between friends and the idea of hope. Morgan freeman is a second to none actor he lays the role perfectly and i could not think what the film would be like without him. all the other actors perform perfectly. this movie is a movie of inspiration and one of which will get people through harsh times. this film always restores my faith in mankind i simply love it. I first saw this film sitting on my brothers desk and i was intrigued by the idea of a film set in prison where hope and other morale values were the storyline instead of violence and havoc, this is a amazing film which brings pride to the actors and crew who produced it. the setting of the movie is one of perfection the Gothic grounds and the stunning facilities astound me i'am finding it hard to put in to words how much this film means to me i would say it is one of the greatest film's ever made in my time and i love it.
Best movie ive seen.

This movie 20 years on is still first class.

Fight Club is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. In addition to presenting a rather fresh take on life, FC also presents its material in a fresh way. My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about. I will say that I cannot recall *ever* having been "asked" by a film to both suspend my disbelief the way this film asks in its third act AND at the same time come to terms with an understanding that there is no room--or need--for disbelief.

My advice would be to watch this movie in full before you judge it. Actually, the movie itself is nothing special, but it has some good stuff. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do, however, drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. The leads' combined talents and charisma have a lot to do with this movie's success. I found the acting to be sensational, the dialogue incredible and the director's abilities to be up to par and then some. It reminds me of some of those Croatian films that were popular back in the 1990s. My final rating comes in at seven out of 10 stars.
Still not as good as Mario Bros 2 best game of the year 70 years in a row
Andy Dufrain? More like Andy Duripoff of Fanboy from the Nickelodeon animated comedy series, Fanboy & Chum Chum
The Shawshark Redemption is very good movie. This is a story that reflect prisons as seen by many prisoner. The Shawshark Redemption also reflect society problems. The plots and actors played very well that make me wanted to continue watch. They are very professional as a director and actor. they capture and identify with America male spirit as it shows in movie. The story is even more interesting seeing red and Andy building a relationship in a prison. Scenes are very good. Overall, this is a fantastic film.Comparing this kind of movie with other type of movie like comedy,I recommended every movie lover to watch this or you will be missing one of the best film.
In my opinion, The Shawshank Redemption is an amazing film in the whole way of action and how we learning from this movie. Shawshank encompasses friendship , hardship , hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going though. These artists show their capability to produce art, real art that in spires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.So, Shawshank is the must see movie in your life before you gone.
An absolutely flawless production. From the story to the acting to the way it was filmed and produced, this is a nearly perfect movie. It was like a great novel brought to life. This is a classic and one of the clear top movies of all time.
As i started watching this i was already convinced that i saw the best movie of 1994.And i don't even get why the director to this film Frank Darabont didn't even win or was nominated for the best director Oscar.This film also has 2 of the greatest performances throughout the whole movie which were the Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman performances.Also this movie deserves to be on the IMDb top 250 because this movie will keep you in your seat from start to finish,and those of you people out there who haven't seen this movie i recommend that you have to watch this movie, And has a great premise as well. The movie also has other great performances from James Whitmore,Bob Gunton,and Clancy Brown.
Why talk so much about this movie when the movie already speaks for itself as one of the best film of all time. The movie is too good to be explain by me; you have to see it for yourself.Exceptional.

Max- 9.5/10
The storyline, the links, the twists, everything about this movie made me want to watch it all over again. It is the best movie I've seen by far. I recommend it 100%.
AH TITLE TOLD IT ALL flhslfkehws;egj;wejg;wjgjwpegewgerhgerherhr
I really can't explain why this movie does absolutely nothing for me. It has a great cast that turns in some good performances, and the story is compelling; however, I always feel so empty after I see it. I get a similar vibe from FORREST GUMP and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, to name a couple others. I can't really figure out why.
The movie depicts how a man can achieve the most incredible feats once sheer will is applied.

The Shawshank Redemption is just an utterly moving motion picture that makes you really have a feel for the characters in this movie. It truly will move you in some sort of way, because it is very deeply emotional at times. Morgan Freeman did an excellent job as always and really put on an amazing role in this movie. Tim Robbins truly stole the show with his Grade A performance. If you have the time to sit through this very long movie, then you should definitely see The Shawnshank Redemption, because it is a motion picture that will make you feel in dept emotions for the characters in the movie, it is by far a classic and one of the best movies of the 90's.
I can understand why this film is loved so much, but I can equally understand, although I do not agree, why it is despised. People say it is life affirming, brings hope and happiness, and it does, others say it is sentimental crap, and at times it is. But I've always been a sucker for sentimental movies, ones which have the power to genuinely move the viewer, and not hide under a cheap plot and a tragic death. Being another King adaptation, there is violence, and hardness to counteract the sentimentality, and the prison, although not as horrifying as those seen in Midnight Express and other movies, breaks the human soul to the point that it relies on the prison for survival. Heartbreaking, tear jerking, brutally funny, all phrases used repeatedly to describe this film, all appropriate. A film everyone should love. Great Quotes: Andy. 'I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged' 9 out of 10

Gut-wrenching! Beautiful! Intelligent! A masterpiece! The actors are perfect in their roles, I am surprised Tim Robbins didn't rise higher in his stardom than what he actually did after making this movie. The chemistry between him and Morgan Freeman is perfect! Every single character makes sense and seems "real". The dialogues are realistic as well. It portrays the corruption going on within heavily guarded facilities (such as this one) in such a simple, yet brutal way - that despite the crime committed (with a few exceptions of course) it makes you question the justice system and its fairness. I can relate to people I would never have thought I would in real life. I won't say much more about this movie, except tell you to watch it! Even if its not your type of movie, even if you tend to get bored with dramatic tales - anyone can learn something from experiencing watching it! Just be prepared to feel real human emotions. If you don't then something is seriously wrong with you!
My friend asked me that question and I said... TODAY

I saw The Shawshank Redemption today, yes nearly after 14 years it was released and after 26 years of my life on earth... I should have seen it much before, I guess. I am truly moved by the story and more than that by the character roles played by Morgan (Red) and Tim (Andy). I have to admit, this is not one of the greatest, BUT THE GREATEST movie ever produced.

Brooks was there, so was Red... I wish I was also there to see it for real.

This movie gave me new avenues, new thoughts, new energy and more than everything... it gave me what it gave Morgan Freeman... HOPE
This film should be joint along with The Godfather as being the greatest film of all time. The character development and the messages that is conveying is beautifully done. When the messages such as hope, friendship and survival come together, it makes an excellent display.

It consisted of different metaphors when they were drinking the liquor on top the roof, and Morgan Freeman was narrating his thoughts as feeling that they were a free man, this was the best moment of the film and made me how at that time people were living in jails.

Excellent. Prefect. Outstanding film, best jail film I saw in my entire life...10/10 PS watch out for the new drama that came out in the UK... Prison Break on channel five. If you liked Shawshank then you will like this.
What can I say? Probably the best movie of all time. Really well written story with a beginning a middle and an end.

The Shawshank Redemption is a film about life in the American Shawshank prison, where corruption among guards and directors plays a major role. Andy Dufresne, a banker, is sentenced to life for the murder of his wife and her lover. However, he maintains that he was innocent. In Shawshank, after a difficult start, he becomes his fellow prisoners. One of them is Red, the narrator of the story, who is charmed by the huge cleverness of Andy. If Andy asks Red if he can come to a geologist hammer, Red, who has the size of the laundry, will deliver this hammer to Andy. The contact flourishes
Real good movie....but has taken a lot from Papillon (1973)
If you haven`t seen this film, watch it as soon as you can. Maybe you`ve had the chance to do it, but just skipped it because you thought it was one more story in prison. Yes and no! YES because most part of "Shawshank Redemption" happens in a prison, but NO, it's not like the others. It's much better.

The story, you may know more of it in the Plot Outline, is really interesting and the performances are just impossible to forget. There is a little of everything: drama, friendship, violence, love and dream..."Dream of Freedom". That's the title in Portuguese.

My Rate 9/10
This is without a doubt my favorite movie. Every time I see this movie I feel touched by its magic. Most of my friends have seen it because I have recommended them to do it and they have all loved it.

Robbins, Freeman and Whitmore's characters are the ones that I like the most.

It is just stupid, unfair and shameful that this wonderful movie was not awarded neither at The Oscars nor The Golden Globes. The IMBD voters have it at #2. My hope is to see it in the future at #1.
Many years I didn't understand why this film is the top rated on IMDb because I didn't watch it. When I did it I wouldn't have any questions. You watch the film and you believe this story. Wondrous cast did the great work, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are the best friends at films ever. Actors in supporting roles did their work great too. So this film is really the best in the world.
Three words: "Cool Hand Luke." Same film, done better, done earlier. For that matter, is this film any better than other Steven King "novelettes" such as "Stand By Me"? All in all, it probably ranks a 6 or a 7, but since people on this site have lost their minds as regards this film, I give it a 1 in one man's attempt at sanity.
I have always heard what a great movie it was but never got myself to watch it since I didn't want to watch a prison movie. However, I am so glad I watched it! I was sort-of suicidal when I watched it; and it gave me hope and made my heart warm even when I was at my lowest!
A movie based on a Stephen King book could be great or awful. Thankfully this was amazing.
This is exactly the type of movie the new era cinema need ... Magic!
Wow! All the good reviews about this movie have already been said, saying something else will be repetitive but watched this movie when I was just 11 years old, barely understood the whole plot. This movie just go re-released in 4K today (14/09/2021) and I bought it to add to my digital library collection and after watching it for real this time I'm totally speechless... Just get this movie, no more comments. This is EPIC👌🏾
One of the rare occasions where the movie is as good if not better than the book.
This is one of my favourite films ever. Why? Well a lot of reasons really. But mostly because of the plot. It contains just about everything needed for a film to really work like art. The actors are superb (note: Freeman - why he didn't receive an Oscar for this one, I'll never understand). The story is great, and written by my all time favourite writer - Stephen King (Misery, Dolores Claiborne, The Shining, Carrie and more), which are all among my absolute top films. Try them out. I promise you all several great movie-moments.

Words cannot encompass how great this film was. The acting, plot, and even the soundtrack was absolutely spot on. I'm not exaggerating it, but this film really felt like it transcended past me just enjoying the film to actually feeling the film in my soul. To feel that pit in your stomach, the ache in your heart, to the warmth that spreads throughout your body, I was just left in awe of the marvel before my eyes. Even after the end credits roll, I was lost for words. My curiosity as to why this film is first in IMDb's Top 250 movies list is finally quenched and I leave with a smile on my face and happiness in my heart. Don't think I'll need to say this but I'll definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone. Just know that the better the films you see, the worse the bad ones get.
The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece. This is a film that focuses on what happens to people when imprisoned. The different experiences had amongst each character are all representative of what kind of person the character is. This movie has gorgeous cinematography and classic dialogue, this paired with the peaceful yet ominous score make an amazing atmosphere. On top of all these technical marvels you also have one of the best stories ever told. The Shawshank Redemption is truly a work of art.
What a great movie. It's been my fave for years but I never knew just how many other people liked it until I saw that it was ranked #1 on the top 250 list here at IMDB. It may not be the greatest movie ever made but everyone who has seen it liked it. I can't imagine anyone hating this movie. The best part of the whole movie is when Red walks down the beach in Mexico and meets his friend on the boat. You know everything's going to be okay after that.
Oh my God, I no doubt about it, love this movie more than any other I've ever seen!!!!! I mean, the script is just breathtakingly brilliant, and the acting was superb, PERFECT even. I can watch this movie any time of the day, because it never gets old and I never like it less. I am so glad to know that it is highly appreciated on here as well, and it needs to be, this movie KICKS ASS!!!!! If you're a hater, you don't know what a good movie is, and get a life, but if you haven't seen this movie, I HIGHLY, "HIGHLY" recommend you see it right away for you have missed out on something special your entire laugh, and truthfully, that makes me sad. SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION IS TRULY THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!

Good movie but 9 is too extreme, is certainly one of the masterpieces of cinema, but like many Hollywood movies there is some bad things, when the protagonist moves down the sewer pipe, in reality it would be caught bad. A very nice movie that you can refer to the way that each of us must do just to get out of certain problems. After all you put poor grades to great films, especially horror. Hardly comes out of jail in a tunnel of excrement, jail and violence and degradation but you can get out mainly in Italy. However great interpretation of Morgan Freeman, many sentences are historical and should keep in mind. In the movies there must be some humanity in this film there is too much violence
What can i say?...The only film to make a grown man cry! No film comes close to this in any way or form,it draws you in from the start-keeps you there and if your like me..turns you to tears at the very last scene!.Enjoy it because no film will ever be made like this again.
One of the best movie in the world.goldfields gorkhdhanda chekan Sisodiya doshala chelsi.
This film is overrated, it can't possibly be the best film ever, there are much better films than that, however it is still a good film.

No matter how much i talk about this movie i wouldn't give it justice. The movie got nominated for a lot of awards won nothing but the people loved it its been the no. 1 movie of all times by over 2 million people votes the story the direction the actors it's a piece of work, it makes you angry, happy, emotional and inspiration. You should watch if you haven't already
Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.

The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.
This is certainly not a bad film but it is Also completely overated in my opinion. This story has been done a million times and How the wardens didn't notice he was chipping through the wall everyday to escape is beyond me. The acting throughout is very good but i am shocked to see this number 1 on the chart.


#2 favorite movie in the database? Mein Gott!! Surely you jest.

Big-budget marquee name rip-off of the ever popular naif-in-prison B-film standard. Except the B movies don't pretend they aren't going for the shock/schlock appeal.

Utter rubbish.

One of the best movies ever made! This movie is a masterpiece not to be forgotten. There is no other movie like this, and you won't regret it if you watch it. I'm.
A film which has every emotion packed in. Tim Robbins is fantastic. Morgan freeman is the typical Morgan Freeman, amazing actor who is in my eyes an all time great which we will not see the likes of again.

Mark Rolston(Alien, Rush Hour, Lethal weapon) and Bob Gumpton(Patch Adams, Broken Arrow, Ace Ventura) play the bad guys you hate to love.

The Shawshank redemption is a film that can be shown in cinemas till the end of time and will sell every showing.
I like this movie.It has a great-deep message about life,freedom and friendship.
I can't understand why Metascore is only 80 for this masterpiece while films like La La Land which are over rated, scored 100. But I'm happy that users, which have less preconceptions than critics, give it justice and rated it TOP 1 on IMDB. It truly deserves it. This is a profound depiction of friendship and redemption, a n inspiring film that everyone should watch, because it has the power to uplift your spirit.
I'm sorry but I just don't get the big deal over this movie.

It is pure melodramatic schmaltz. Give me Cool Hand Luke or Papillon any day. Or how about Scum or even Chopper.

I have to admit I felt the same way about The Green Mile, maybe it's just Stephen King's view of prison I don't like. As if he has a clue!

I think he should just stick with the coming of age stuff (loved Stand By Me) and the isolated looneys (The Shining), things he can obviously relate to. Leave prison stories to the folks who actually leave their house.

I am pretty sure I have watched it more than 50 times now , and I will watch it a 100 times more, shared the experience of this work of art and recommended it to many many people because i felt it will be selfish to keep it to myself. The movie is ageless, timeless and pure, it sticks with you forever. The shawshank redemption isn't just a movie, it is a feeling.
My lifetime favourite movie in Hollywood. Can't believe such a wonderful screenplay and characterization in jail. This movie will be speaker for generations. Hatssof To the screenwriting and director. Morgan always rocks. Salute to director and screenwriting

You may think 10/10 is a given, but the way I see it 10/10 is perfection. This movie is NOT perfect. It relies too much on the ending. The first 2 hours of the movie ( great as it is ) is lacking complexity. The remaining 20 minutes fools you into thinking it's the best movie ever made. But I am here to tell you It's NOT! I love this movie with all my heart but I just don't think it deserves the number one spot.
Shawshank may not be the best film of all time, but for me it was perfect. A film is perfect (for me) if it shows a character who wins against insurmountable odds (Robbins). Another essential ingredient for a perfect film is a character who, by his actions, changes the life of another human being for the better (again, Robbins). The last 15 minutes of the film are so gripping: we don't know what is going to happen to Freeman, but we are so involved at this point that any other ending would be unthinkable. I loved this film!

This film is nothing but one cliche after another. Having seen many of the 100's of prison films made from the early 30's to the 50's, I was able to pull almost every minute of Shawcrap from one of those films.

While it is visually well made and acted, the story has every plot point of the "standard" prison film. They have the evil warden, innocent main character, friendly guilty guy, thugs and one good old prisoner. Don't waste your time on this one. Rent or buy some of the classic's of the prison genre.
Best movie. Must see. Engrossing. Great story, good acting, good direction.
I have read tons of people getting off watching this pile of random prison drama, and I cannot believe this is the highest rated movie on IMDb.

I never liked Morgan Freeman. Really. He always plays the wise man in movies, and that is quite unbearable. Not only it jails him (lol) to a specific, unrisky role as an actor, but it's also outrageously pretentious. Tim Robbins is OK I guess.

So you get to see some fishy business involving cigarettes and rocks for two hours, spiced by some five-year-old melancholic philosophy.

End of story, If you like prison drama, go watch The Green Mile.

I wasted two hours so you won't, you're welcome.

My impression is that since the early ninenties and especially after "green fried tomatoes" was released movies regarding human relations and/or tragedy and using narative as their spine became fashionable..Countless movies followed that i dont care to mention most of them inferior than the original they tried to follow and one of them is Shawshank redemption.Sure it is not a mellow love story but about life in prison that is objectively hard.But somehow the typical ingredients are there.The film is mostly sad and melodramatic and one can even consider it romantic in a way.Despite its strong cast and a good storyline it does not avoid all these characteristic cliches that sadly deprive it from any real replay value.Rent it on dvd and you wont be disapointed by viewing it but the second best movie of all times it aint and you will know this because you wont feel the need to watch it now and then as it happens at least to me with movies that are really classics...Not a bad movie but highly overrated....3 out of five stars.
This movie was excellence at it's best. In my mind, it is great if you can watch a long movie and just not want it to end. That's what this one did to me. Besides the point that the acting was some of the best you'll see in the 90's. The story was golden. If you haven't seen this, get it now.
Shawshank redemption is world's best movie ever made. I will remember this movie throughout my life. Pls pls watch this movie. It will change your perspective.
The Shawshank Redemption lost the Academy Award for Best Picture to the new visual effects technology utilized in Forrest Gump. In addition, Shawshank only made 10% of the box office gross as Gump, which received far more press coverage due to the visual effects used in the film. Gump is a great film and deserved the Oscar for visual effects, but its story does not compare to the brilliance of Shawshank. The ability to see Tom Hanks shaking hands with dead presidents in the White House amazed movie goers and the box office receipts amazed the Academy members. Shawshank is an amazing story and an outstanding film; whereas, Gump is a series of vignettes exploited by the new visual effects technology.
The Shawshank Redemption is an excellent example of Hollywood craftsmanship. It has believable acting, excellent pacing, good cinematography and tells the story in a very effective manner. But it is film as a craft, not as an art.

To put this film in the same category as those of Kubrick, Kurosawa, Truffaut or Bergman is like comparing a piece of quality furniture to a Picasso.

I doubt even one in a hundred people, who hold this film in such high regard as to vote it #2, could actually name the director if you asked them in the street.
This is a great movie. At first, when I heard that Stephen King was one of the authors I didn't expect it to be this good, I don't enjoy horror movies but later I understood that it wasn't a horror movie so I watched it and I enjoyed every minute of it. Excellent performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.
Absolutely the best movie I have seen in my lifetime. I'm a hardcore action fan, but I sat and watched this movie and never checked the time. This movie is compelling. Tim Robbins gives a great performance nonetheless, but it is Morgan Freeman's character that adds such emotion to the movie. I always catch the movie on TNT and I watch it to the end. The end is fantastic, and it leaves me with tingles (if you know what I mean). Morgan Freeman's line "Get busy living, or get busy dying..." is one to remember. He adds so much feeling to the movie, and the entire thing is flawless. There isn't a line or scene out of place in the entire thing. I sat there thinking hard about the movie for a while, but then I got up and headed to the nearest shop. That movie was going to be my own.
in my opinion ,it's better than the ordinary Monte Cristo story that we all know as the greatest escape tale , so this time the escape is greater! and the hero is an ordinary man , who is so patient and hopeful, while you watch the first few minutes of the film you may think that it's social or silly story, but minute by minute you will recognize that you were wrong, it's a Brilliant Story,a never seen before , a very powerful drama .. the best thing in that movie was the relations between characters,like hating,and true friendship like the one which was between Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman,

I like this movie and i advice every one on the planet to watch it as soon as possible....
This wasn't a bad movie by any means, in fact it was pretty good. Good story, good acting, fairly dramatic, it has most of the key elements in place. But after reading the book, which was amazing, watching this drawn out film version just isn't the same. Compared to some of the modern junk that's out there, Shawshank is pretty solid. But overall, it truly is overrated, and #2 all time is silly.
Best movie ever. I've seen it about 25 times now, and it never gets boring.
"The Shawshank Redemption" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.

I am dumbfounded by the exorbitant praise for this movie. It is almost frightening--like a cult. I watched it last night and was completely underwhelmed. This did not have have half the emotional charge of a dozen other prison flicks, not to mention other dramatic categories. Yes, the story was OK, good (not great) acting, but I found it to be largely insipid and predictable. It just did not grab me like other stories of redemption such as A Christmas Carol or It's a Wonderful Life. As you can see by my citing these two films, I am not offended by cheesy sentimentality, if well done. Shawshank simply had nothing new to say or a new way to say it. The only reason I am writing this review is to demonstrate that there are indeed some people who are not swept away by this movie. Otherwise, I would not have bothered. The film simply was not interesting enough.
This movie is easily one of the greatest movies of all time. "The Shawshank Redemption" is an adaptation of Stephen King's novella titled "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption". This movie is truly a masterpiece with the perfect casting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. The lessons you learn, the emotions that were touched, the friendships that were made and overall, the redemption that every character got in their own way is what made this movie special. This movie teaches you about hope and institutionalization which means being stuck in one place for so long that it's all you ever know. It shows the darkness about being in prison. In conclusion, this movie is a 10/10. Hands down one of the greatest movies ever and I'll definitely rewatch it in the future.
This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. If you haven't watch it yet, just GO! Watch it! Now!
This is the #1. Absolute must see film of the 1990s, Our Generation, anyone's lifetime and quite possibly the history of film. Hope and perseverance are front and center as themes in this blockbuster. Anyone of any age any race either sex and any religion should see this and I promise you'll wish to share it with everyone you know. Don't think "another Prison Movie" about-this one, it's above and beyond that cliché. Expect career performances from Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Bob Gunton, and James Whitmore. Along side many outstanding character performances from the supporting cast. I Cannot emphasize-the importance of this film. I personally thank Everyone involved in producing such an enormous telling of Steven Kings masterpiece. It has become a source of daily inspiration for me and I continue to watch it Several times a year to this day. thank you.

Share some of the sentences in this movie. 1.It takes a strong man to save himself, and a great man to save another. 2.Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.
When I first saw this movie in 1994, before the hype, I thought it was a passable flick; nothing special and certainly in keeping with the usual schmaltz expected from any non-horror Stephen King work. In fact, with the exception of Morgan Freeman's excellent performance, I found it imminently forgettable. Then, lo, came the Academy Awards with a surprising nomination for Best Picture. Then, even worse, came the belated hype from its legion of fans. I could not understand this adoration of a movie that was as sugar-coated as that other saccharine movie of 94, Forrest Gump. Worse than Gump's unpalatable cuteness, however, was Shawshank's genre clichés: the rape scene, the prisoner's pet, etc. Had no-one seen Escape From Alcatraz or Birdman of Alcatraz? For me, Shawshank is possibly the most overrated film ever made, a fact emphasised by its place at No. 2 in the IMDb top 250.

They say there are no perfect movies. Most of the time that holds true. But this is the one exception. I find no faults in The Shawshank Redemption. It is indeed a perfect film if ever there was one. It is wildly entertaining and extremely insightful. You won't want to blink for fear of missing something. You are able to identify and sympathize with the main character, and with his friend, who provides the greatest bits of narration of any film ever. This is not an exaggeration. Furthermore, we learn something about ourselves and our fellow human beings by watching this film. It is a work of art and a bit of real life. The production values are amazing. It should have won ten Oscars.
Best Movie With The Best Close Ending Ever Seen Although Its So Old But It Kept making Me Go Back And see it.

The Shawshank Redemption is an exciting and very emotional excursion. It is the best "jail" movie ever made, for sure. There's suspense, surprises, and more, but it's true greatness is in it's show of the human spirit triumphing over impossible odds. With a pair of great actors and a very nice script, The Shawshank Redemption winds up getting a 10/10 from me.
Masterpiece.One of the best if not the best movie ever made.Wish i have the chance to watch it for 1st time again.A top 3 movie with no doubt.


The Best inspirational movie. HOPE is a good thing and it's the best thing. "HOPE"
I've never read the book, so I'm not sure if the book and the script conflict. Either way, it is a very good movie. However, there are many inconsistencies through out the movie which ruin it for me. If you break down the movie in to individual scenes, the movie shows its perfections and imperfections. The characters are believable, with the storyline also being fairly solid. My favorite scene is the tar/roof top scene. Very well done. Very real life. The weakest part of the movie is the ending. There are more inconsistencies and continuity problems in the ending and I think it is because they rushed the ending.

I'd like to get the BlueRay version of this and watch the special items for this movie. I'd like to see the making of it and the behind the scenes.


Cannot see why this film is rated so highly. Sure, its watchable and nicely inoffensive, but its not really about much, and nothing really happens. Just a film about a bloke going to prison. Somewhere along the line I think I must have missed something, because I can think of at least a hundred better films. Saying that, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are flawless, though the latter's best film will always be the Hudsucker Proxy. (Which incidentally is a better film.)
Loved this mivue must see. This is a very interesting movie and a must see. Action packed and popcorn and chill.

Fear Can Hold You Prisoner, Hope Can Set You Free. Some people's wings are so bright that even the darkest prison in the world cannot encircle them for a long time. This film tells a simple story, a redemption, in exchange for freedom. Besides the belief drive him to do so. This film is moving, it also makes many people grow up.
The best movie I have ever seen. The best movie I have ever seen, a story full of ups and downs and stress that constantly encourages you to watch.
"The Shawshank Redemption" is a movie about time. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption
I have literally just turned off the DVD player after watching this film for the very first (and last) time after so much hype I thought it was about time. I sat all the way through it and did enjoy it, but I really don't see what all the fuss is about. Yes it is a good film, yes it is a good plot. However I had guessed the outcome and a few bits within the film before the flashback at the end, and therefore for me there were no unexpected twists. I wasn't even moved at the end. In fact all in all I was a bit disappointed, as my friends who have seen it said that they had cried and it was such a brilliant film. Am I abnormal???????? I think the green mile was better and I did cry at the end of that. I'm sorry if I upset any of you who think it is the best film ever, but I don't.

Hope is a good thing never give up hope. Hope can you free.
The Shawshank Redemption is an absolutely terrific movie that shows why Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are two of the finest actors alive today. I predict years from now Shawshank will be held up as a true American classic. This is a flawless film. My one regret is that I never saw this on the big screen. (I think the odd name 'Shawshank Redemption' and the fact that it was a Stephen King story kept me away initially [thank goodness for cable TV]) I urge anyone who reads this to please see this movie. It is the best film I have ever seen about life and hope.
L have nothing to say.it's a story about hope.and it's use montage technique,a deep suspense.lt tru that everyone love it

Just loved this movie, every characters and acting are phenomenal.
The good points of this movie have already been stated in the other posts, so I will stick to the points I feel detracted from the movie. This movie never gripped me, I never really felt all that emotionally involved with the characters. Even though 19 years passed in the story, I never got the sense of time passing as I have in other movies that have storylines that span decades. All the characters who weren't prisoners were very one-dimensional. Overall, it was a pretty good movie, but I don't think it belongs in the top 250.
This movie is full of suspension, drama, excitement, knowledge, etc, . I loved this movie, previously before watching this movie i thought that how prisoners go and how they feel. Know i understand they all are innocent 😇.
One of the best movies .It give us an inspiring message that one should never give up in his/her life.


This movie told us the value of patience. Definately recommended.

It's very rare that you find such diversity in a movie now days. I like the story and it's concept.A thumping good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since "The Crying Game." The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and uplifting, not to mention Oscar-worthy film. In 2006, it was ranked as the greatest film ever by Empire, a film magazine. The year it came out it was nominated for 7 academy awards but did not win a single one because of a movie you may all remember, Forrest Gump. It's the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving. Some of "The Shawshank Redemption'' comes across as outrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil.
What can i say that already hasn't been said? Nothing. It's amazing, amazing characters and iconic lines and scenes. And when it ended i just sat there with a big smile on my face for 10 minutes. Watch it.
There are great movies & then there's The Shawshank Redemption. It's timeless & it has filled me with hope many times when I was down. Pure magic, won't write more as everything has already been written many times by many.


It's not a bad film. It's just derivative and melodramatic. It borrows from "Cool Hand Luke," a superior film. It relishes its significance too much. It's a bit smug. Morgan Freeman's voiceover is a clumsy narrative device. I don't know -- I just know for sure it's not one of "the best films of all time." Not even close.
This is one of the best movies about "friendship" I've ever seen, also one of the best prison movies. I found it better than Robert Redford's "CASTLE". Morgan Freeman was perfect as usual and I can say that Tim Robbins reached the top of his performance and also his career. I wish this couple come together for another movie, the kind of it is not important I'm sure the spectators will have the same taste as before. I watched most of the films of Morgan Freeman and I can say this was the best of his, normally he prefers to play in films like "Seven","Kiss the girls","Along came a spider",... but I think he should think again that which kind of his films stay at the top of the charts...
After seeing this movie I could not notice to be misled by the IMDB rating. The movie is nice, even good, but no way it should receive a 9.0.

The movie could easily have been produced by Disney: strong moral & a happy ending. Sure, there are strong points. The scene of the old man who have been imprisoned for almost his whole life is very well placed and Tim Robbins' performance is good but the story itself does not leave anything behind.

3 out of 5. That's all there is to it.
Outstanding movie brilliant direction and great acting.
This is the best drama that I have ever seen. Morgan Freeman was beyond amazing, and was one of my favorite aspects of the movie. The story was perfect. I genuinely cannot think of a single critique of this movie. I advise you to drop whatever you are doing and watch this now!
Very good performances from Freeman and Robbins. Good writing. The best move ever? Nope. I gave it a 8 out of 10.

As a libertarian, my own feelings about freedom, power, and corruption are apparently quite a bit stronger than either Darabont or Stephen King.

when i began to watch this movie,i just said to myself,this should be the best i ever saw in my life,judging the IMDb rating and Kinopoisk rating!and it really haven't disappointed me! i learned,that if you want something so much,and the wish to achieve a thing or to get something is bigger and greater than anything else,this will obviously happen! there is nothing more important than to believe in yourself,to believe in justness, in the right choice of destiny! there are things that i disliked in the movie,but those awesome moments just overcome all the misses! I'm gonna watch it again...cause there still remain a lot of meanings and messages that i must follow! Hope is the best thing that can ever happen to you! never loose it!
I think its obvious to anyone that has seen this movie that its quite possibly the best film ever. Its just perfect, iv watched it so many times but its gets better every time, in fact the last time i watched it, it brought a tear to my eye just as it finished. And i know, that sounds quite sad but, anyone who has seen film and understands the sheer quality of its brilliance! Don't get me wrong, there are other brilliant films but this this one stands out amongst all others, if you haven't seen this movie then i strongly advise that you make it your #1 priority.

11/10
Towards the end, dealing with Freeman's loneliness, I felt how he was feeling. These are believable criminals. People say these guys are too nice to be hard-core criminals, but people make mistakes. The guys' mistakes were on a big-time scale. One line will remain with me forever : Get busy livin, or get busy dying.

Well, Get busy watching or get busy goin';
I cannot possibly realize why this movie is rated in top movies. There is nothing new in this film and there isn't anything in it that makes it special. Wake up people! Quote Bill Hicks "Piece of Sh*t".

OK I'll give it that there isn't anything to complain about the acting or directing, etc. But this entire movie seems to be a compromise. I also think that the success of this film is based on the "least worst principle" and that makes it bad.

I'm also fed up with the narrator and all the dramatic film music. All this seems like fishing Oscar nominations. Am I really the only one who can see how transparent this is? I doubt it so please vote movies that really will make difference.
It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Out of my top 5 worst movies this would be in at least the top 3 movies I hate. It is just so boring and everytime I turn on TNN or something it is on! By far one of the worst movies ever!

This is such a good movie! Excellent screenplay and directing. And the casting is fantastic; everyone just fit their part like a hand in glove. The whole story flows smoothly that you forget it's all make-believe.

I told one of my friends many times to watch this film and it took her years before she actually did. Once finished she said, "What took me so long? This movie is soooo good!".
Stephen King's stories usually do not translate well to movies (Carrie, The Running Man), but occasionally, a King story is done right (Shining, Stand By Me). This movie is probably the best of the group. It's a brilliant story matched with a brilliant screenplay. The cast was great from the professionals (Robbins, Freeman) to the relatively unknown actors. This movie is about a man's will to survive even when his future looks the darkest. One of my all time favorite movies.
Indeed... This is the best movie in history. An outclass script. And beautiful narration.
I watched it a few years ago and i dont really remember the story in details, but i remember that i had i lot of emotions here and this movie give you some life lessons. Morgan Freeman is genius!
Perfection! 10 is to little for this movie. This is MASTERPIECE! People have no reason not give this movie a ten!
I'm not saying that Shawshank Redemption is a bad movie, in some ways it's perfect. The storytelling is seamless and unquestionable, the characters are bright and strong. Villains with motivation. Heroes are not idiots. Events are justified by circumstances that push the heroes to independent actions. But my God, there are so many films that are so many times more worth your time and emotional energy that Shawshank Redemption is a quiet and meditative movie that is hard to watch at times. It's impossible for me personally to worry about characters that look so fake and created specifically for this story. They cannot be imagined in other circumstances, outside the picture. The lack of deep meanings and the possibility of different interpretations of the characters and what is happening is annoying. In general, he may just not be my type, but in the end it's just one of the opinions.

A film of hope, lessons, life and freedom. This is one of the greatest films of our times - highly recommended viewing!

9/10.
I love this film to bits, even though it can be hard to watch.

This is an amazing movie. I can watch it time and time and time again
The Shawshank Redemption, one of the rare works of Stephen King that does not contain horror elements, has always been the subject of discussion in cinema conversations. Some say it's the best movie ever, while others think it's the most over-rated movie ever.. I think it's one of the best movies ever.
How the hell did this get voted number one in the top 250? Meandering adaptation of a tight little King short. Typically hammy performances and so sugary you could drop it into the world's water system and everyone would go hyper.

It's okay, as adaptations go, but there is soooo much better out there.

Steev
This film was totally amazing and is my favourite film of all time. This film humanizes the characters in prison which something we don't see in many Hollywood films as they dehumanize the prison characters. Also, it depicts the cruelt of prison very well and all the characters in this movie were amazing! Even the side characters were very engaging to watch. I actually tested up at the end of this movie. I strongly recommend this film to you if you haven't watched it yet
This drama has been widely vaunted as one of the best films ever made- personally I just can't see the appeal. Sure it contains very good performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman- but there have been other, much better screen performances by other actors. There is very little suspense or originality about the plot and nothing that hasn't been seen or done on screen a hundred times before. So why the popularity? It's a formulaic feel-good movie who's happy ending is never in doubt. Knowing that Stephen King wrote the novel on which the film was based would probably give that away anyway. As with any adaptation from book to film there are several differences between the two, though the film does, on this occasion, improve on the book.

There have been better adaptations of King novels (The Shining) and better performances by better actors, yet for some reason this film continues to be rated as better than it actually is.
This movie proves its worth of having top spot on IMDb list.It is not only entertaining but also with a lesson never loose hope as it is the best thing a man can have.Great acting displayed by lead actors specially Morgan freeman.Truly a moving movie with great moral&climax.Dialouges of this film are well written. You will miss something if HAVE not watch it. Highly recommendable for those who have give up their hope in life. they will find how hope will get best of them.I will say that viewers have truly voted for this film without under influence of big & popular name as it usually happens.Like godfather.Godfather is nice film but not nice enough to give points above 9 to it.

So i watched this film maybe 10 times Russian version, 5 original English. Read both book versions. It's beautiful story! When i have watched this film first time, after started to follow the career of the actor Morgan Freeman. He is a great actor. I give the film 10 stars
Tim Robbins as a banker who goes to prison being accused of murdering his wife and her lover.Sentence: life in prison.Morgan Freeman is his fellow inmate "Red" and William Sadler is Heywood.Later a young inmate, Gil Bellows as Tommy joins in.The poster of Rita Hayworth has a big role in the film.Later it's Marilyn Monroe and finally it's Raquel Welch.Frank Darabont directed this marvelous film based on Stephen King's short story.It's one of the best movies made of King's stories.Probably the best one alongside The Shining (1980).The acting is superb.The story is fantastic.The Shawshank Redemtion is a big movie.A kind of movie we should see more often.
Well there's not much you can say about this movie except that it is the Best movie of all time and no other Movie will top this great Great movie If you have not seen it sit back clear your mind and watch it and make sure you are not bothered while watching it that way you can fully understand the film and its purpose.So out of a 1-10 scale I give it a 10+++++++ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT RENT IT!!!!!!!!
I cant describe how amazing this movie is, but i dont have to because almost everyone saw it and if you havent... what are you waiting for? Probably the best movie on earth
Andy has a better place is that he did not give up all the thinking in his outside life, he was not convinced by the institutionalized life in prison. In other words, he still insisted on his own heart and did not lose himself. This is the most important point of life. If you don't know why you are alive, it can only be a walking body, not an emotional person.
Frank Darabont has created a good film about the misuse of criminal justice system and the obnoxious corruption in prisons.He has done this by showing an insider's view of a penitentiary from the perspective of its inmates.Although Tim Robbins has a good role in this film as Andy,he is surpassed by Red played by Morgan Freeman.He is at the summit of his acting prowess as everything is written on his face.There is no other actor in Hollywood or elsewhere who could have done this role of Red with absolute conviction as Morgan Freeman. Shawshank Redeption tells us in clear terms that in prisons it is the rule of everyman for himself but sometimes there are exceptions. Feelings of suffering,sadness,trust,joy,companionship occur which give the prisoners the hope to carry on.It is nice that there is not much focus on feminine characters as they did not have anything that could have justified their presence.
This film, if it isn't one of the greatest of all time, at least I can say it is one of the greatest I've ever seen. This is a must-recommend, because to be honest, this is one of the many movies a movie lover must see before they die. It is not just a great film, but a great experience. And it is quite the experience! Morgan Freeman gives the performance of his career in this film. I give props to the director for making him narrate the film as well. He is just that great. Tim Robbins give a very underrated performance in this film. Freeman stole the show, but there was a certain subtlety of Robbins' that can't go without being recognized. Either way, both these men give their full effort into this film. There is a great atmosphere around this film as well, it's a subtle tone, as this is a subtle, (But great) film, but it changes when it needs to change, and it knows exactly when. As a matter-of-fact, what makes this movie great is that it knows exactly when it needs to do something powerful, thoughtful or sentimental, and to be honest as a moviegoer, that is all I can ask for.
One of those films you must see in your lifetime. The soundtrack alone is five stars! Sublime acting all around. A film that may have been a slow burn in popularity but has now established itself as a true hollywood masterpiece!! 🏅

P.s. my all time fav line: "the funny thing is, on the outside I was an honest man. Straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook."
What a complete masterpiece this film is, from the first line spoken to the zoom-out in the end. The actors are all great, but Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins really do outstanding performances. This is probably my all time favorite film and to anyone who hasn't seen it there's only one thing I can say: Please do! You won't be disappointed.
I wait for the day when this film is no longer in the top 200 of IMDb, as it deserves. Please, if any film was passed over in favor of Gump at the 1995 Oscars--it was the best film of the nineties--PULP FICTION.
This is perhaps one of the best movies I have ever seen and no doubt the best of Stephen King. Director Frank Darabont created a masterpiece.

It is a very intelligent story telling us how hard prison life can be. It critics the judgements of innocent prisoners. But the most I liked is that every time there is another interesting story that develops in this prison. At the last third of the movie we can enjoy the big surprise or the dessert. This novel is very nice told and it merits standing ovation. I and my wife rarely see such films. This is quality of film making and today where we are? 8.5/10.

If you liked this don´t miss another masterpiece from the same director called "THE GREEN MILE".
This movie is one of the greatest I have ever seen. Morgan Freeman gives an unbelievable performance in this work. The direction of it is exquisite (and gives much to Tim Robbins character, I know he is a good actor, but the direction gives so much more to him). The soundrack is unparalleled and the story is exquisite (thanks to Stephen King). I have seen many greats, Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Cuckoo's Nest, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now....etc. This movie is fantastic, and the fact it didnt' win (or even get nominated) for an Oscar is the reason I don't pay attention to the Oscars anymore. This movie is fantastic, and an artistic triumph. I have no respect for the Academy for ignoring this flick.

Like a lot of people, didn't really seem an interesting title when it was released. WHOA. This is a movie that I know I've watched the most number of times than any other movie. Fantastic movie.

Shawshank is by far the most grossly overrated films of all time. To say that this is better than Lawrence of Arabia, better than Alien, Better then Saving Private Ryan, is just ridiculous. This movie is weak, as are all the characters in it. I'll never forgot the scene where the old man hangs himself after leaving prison and the piano symphony kicks in. Why should I feel sorry for him? Try living in Africa buddy and tell me how hard your life is. This movie is for weak people who love to shed a tear for prisoners and overall just weak people. Now I love the director of this and Stephen King, but im sorry, this isn't a masterpiece, it's forcing the audience into the characters emotional problems that few can relate. Go see the Green Mile instead.

Rating = D-

This movie takes you through all kinds of emotions. It's an absolute classic. And with the two wonderful protagonist actors, it's definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. I've watched it 3 or 4 times and never gets boring.

Can't believe it didn't win anything... Morgan Freeman was suoerb. He and Tim Robbins should win an award... and yes. This is how movie should be made. It touches your soul, make you feel good and grateful.
amongst so many films that are really well known and stink and blockbusters that stink. This is not a blockbuster but a classic to all movie buffs and it is becoming more and more known and appreciated. I love this film. I have seen it the for the third time recently and still it brings tears into my eyes at some points. The cast is great, with Morgan Freeman and a great Tim Robbins. I still do not know what to think of Andy (Robbins), did he do it or didn't he. There are several hints in the film but I still do not know, for Andy is a hard man to see through.

WATCH THIS MUST SEE

8 out of 10
I had heard about the movie since it first came out, but somehow, I never got around to watching it. Now, I super-glad that I watched it. It is an utterly fantastic movie, to the max. The movie contains almost every human emotion that there is, and overall, it is a totally wonderful character study, as well. There is marvelous writing, and a totally well thought-out plot, and the acting talent throughout is on an almost otherworldly level. It is a movie that captured my attention from the very beginning, keeping me totally engaged throughout for the entire duration of the film. All said, this is yet another movie that I truly wish that I could give more than ten stars, because it truly deserves many, many stars.
Too sentimental, too pathetic, too slow, too conventionally made, and the voice over explaining everything ruins it completely, making it boring as hell. By far the most overrated film of all times.
This is a very fine movie that was unfortunately somewhat overlooked when it was first released. Word of mouth and critical acclaim has resulted in the movie becoming one of the best known and loved films of recent times.

The story tells of the imprisonment of Andy Dufresne (Robbins) at the harsh Shawshank prison. Gradually over time he befriends Red (Freeman) who is the fixer in the prison who can get hold of any items at a price. Andy channels his frustration into making things better at the prison. The smallest achievement is celebrated and used as impetus for the next challenge. The film should really make the viewer treasure the things that we all take for granted on a day to day basis. The other interesting aspect of the film is the institutionalisation as portrayed with Brooks. he has been in prison for so long he cannot (and does not want to) survive on the outside. 9/10

A very deep, very powerful actor, a very beautiful and engaging film that you don't tap into, and you enjoy it minute by minute, I advise you to take a pen and pen with you when you see this video to write down the tips that will teach you to use it later in your life. At the end of the film, you'll feel a real sense of freedom, and you'll feel all the sadness and sorrow you saw in the film, as if none had happened. To put it this way, it's all over. I strongly suggest it.

This film is a masterpiece and clearly deserved 10/10
I do not even feel as though I need to go into a great amount of detail to explain just how amazing this film is.

You've probably seen the movie sitting on the top spot of 'IMDB's top 250', or maybe you've heard a friend babble on about how great the movie is and know it must be half-decent. I can assure you this will live up to your expectations. The acting, the plot, the setting, the cast, the directing, the messages and symbols, the acting again (deserves another mention) is just about as perfect as a movie can be in this setting. Please don't waste your time pondering over whether or not to see this movie or whether or not you should believe the hype because, I can assure you, you can. Go buy this from your local movie store or buy it online - I really don't care - just make sure you watch this film before anything else. As an 18-year-old guy, I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. Go watch it! Now!
The plot and the actors amazed me. The ninetees clearly were the best era of movies and this one is a great example.

It's boring, i don't care about the characters. Overrated to madness. The movie could have been way darker, feels like a disney adventure.

Great acting, ok story.
This film is a truly awesome film once i had started watching the first 10 minutes of it i was addicted to the TV and could do nothing but to watch it. This story is about a respectable banker (Andy Duframe) who is sentenced to Shawshank prison for life imprisonment for a crime he did not commit. Once he arrives at Shawshank he soon starts to learn that the prison mentally takes your life. However, Andy seems very unusual being very quite and polite around the prison. At the spectacular climax at the end of this film it just gives the viewer such an amazing feeling of hope and in my opinion this is the best film every made. A must watch film!!! 10/10
I have to say that it was just fine, but not as great as some are making it to be.
Not so nice and boring. They have to get better with their movies
I'll keep this short and sweet. I am not the type of person who reads critique reviews and determines whether that will make me watch a movie or not. However, I didn't think I would ever want to see this movie after seeing the preview and a friend said it was a bit slow. I have to honestly say that I was impressed by the directing, acting and overall story. This is a great move! You should defiantly take the time out of your life to see a great movie that is not a superhero remake. This story has structure, purpose and meaning. Though, if you can't sit still then don't bother. However, I do think it's time we get some culture back in our lives.
This movie doesn't deserve a 10, it deserves a 11...

This is the best movie I ever saw, everything on the movie is great, the story, the acting, the message, just everything. I spoke with so many people that saw this movie, and everyone of them said that The Shawshak Redemption is a truly masterpiece.

If someone is reading this- please stop reading and go and watch the movies if you haven't yet, because you will see one of the best movies ever made in human history. It is the best rated movie (9.2) and when I see that rating Im just asking myself "why is there just a 9.2 instead of a 10??
This is a classic about hope. Hope is not in prison. The owner, gong'an Di, was misunderstood and imprisoned. Relying on his inner firmness, he saved his life with wisdom and hope, saved the prison with a small hammer, and sowed the seeds of hope into everyone's heart.
Are there people still left to watch this masterpiece? I'm talking to them, this ain't a /sci-fi/action/thriller/mystery/comedy/ movie. No CGI, No gut crunching actions. A drama yet so natural with exceptional acting moments. Just some prisoners talking to each other. Yet it is in the list of all time best. Yes, the makers might have prompted some magic spells same way like they did to the script.

It couldn't win the Oscars but pretty sure it will win your hearts . The Most influential movie for me.
After I have seen this movie over a dozen times, in different phases of my life, I can help you by saying this is a milestone to have, not only as a movie fan, as well as a person to see, in this story, that hope is the last and first resource. More than twenty years after I saw this for the first time, I can still remember how I felt then and still share the same emotion now that I am a father and an adult with a consciousness of life. Yes, this is entertainment but also something to witness. Regards to everyone involved in the making of this touching masterpiece.
In the first thirty minutes of watching this show on a slow Saturday afternoon I knew it was my favorite. I was captured instantly by how the story unfolded. You can't help but deeply respect Andy Dufrain (I don't know if thats spelled correctly). The way he speaks with thought and hope, the way he walks about the jail collecting rocks. Seemingly oblivious to the fact that he is imprisoned in a jail. They couldn't have found a person that suited the roll of Red better than Morgan Freeman. His voice is perfect for the narration of the film. Every card played by this movie was an ace. From the way they filmed the tall, barren walls of the prison to the brilliant story( thanks to Stephen King for that), and let's not forget the music. I am pleased to see that it's in the top spot of this site, I think it deserves it.
I really recommend this MP. I thank all the casting, directors, producers, writers and other staff for crafting this unforgettable movie. I give 10/10 for leaving a smile on my face at the end and joy in my heart. Thank you!
One of the top movies i have ever watch! Must seen!
It makes you feel stuff. This movie makes you feel emotion. It's awesome, a classic, and really not that overrated
"Redemption by Shawshank" turns life into a cruel choice. Shawshank's redemption is something we have to remember repeatedly in our simple lives. Believing in yourself, not giving up hope, giving up effort, and waiting patiently for your own glory in life, is Shawshank's redemption.
Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) bides his time during twenty years' imprisonment for the murder of his wife in this adaptation of a Stephen King story. And being Stephen King, the setting is once again Maine, though you'll find 'Shawshank State Prison' in Ohio. It's the forbiddingly Gothic Mansfield Reformatory, 100 Reformatory Road, Mansfield, on US Route 30, about 80 miles southwest of Cleveland.

Built between 1886 and 1910, the reformatory remained in operation until 1990 and was scheduled for demolition when the film was made. In fact, much of the prison yard has now gone to make room for the adjacent Richland Correctional Institution, but the striking Administration Building lives on as a tourist attraction. Find it just north of downtown Mansfield, off South Olivesburg Road.

Shawshank Redemption narrates a beautiful story of two prisoners bonding over the number of years. Their experiences in the prison and the chemistry between two (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) have been shot with terrific care.Editing and Screenplay of this movie are among the best in any movie you will see.

The credit goes to director on shaping the movie in such an interesting way and the ending of the movie is arguably among one of the very bests. One might feel the movie is a bit slow at times, but you are always into the plot which brings on new surprises consistently.

Overall, this is the sort of movie you will remember for long time and a benchmark among the "feel good" movies. MUST WATCH.
I saw this movie few years back.i was immature, i didn't get what this movie was offering True Meaning Of Friendship,Patience, to see every Perspective of turns whether its hard or not we face during our lifetime.. Really a strong movie must watch

I watched three times,every time i have different feelings .
"A long road to freedom, and a soul of washing, an immortal motivational classic," hope "follow the will of god sleep was hollowed out of the bible in inside pages, attached to the Andy tall body, near 500 yards of the sewer, in the end, the only dirty way took Andy to the beautiful new world.
The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it. An absolutely encouraging story to those who are desperate or sad or complaining about bad luck. If you never give up and try to figure out a way ahead, nothing can stop you to the brightness and freedom. Everything you have experienced will bring you positive influences if you take it positively. I have watched it for many times, at least ten times I guess. Now I hope I can download it and keep it and enjoy it once I have time. I used it to encourage people around me, for example, a girl friend who's suffering from the depression, a workmate who has just lost his favorite pet, and a friend who lost his job recently.

Okay so many people may be wondering why I hate such a "beautiful work of literature" or "The best story ever told on screen". Well there are too many reasons to list in my maximum of 1,000 words. So instead I will give a few obvious reasons on why I truly hate this movie. Being a teenager I enjoy movies like "Mystic River" and "Donnie Darko". You know psychological thrillers. Well this is nothing of the sort. "The Shawshank Redemption" is what I classify as a Sleeping movie. The name says it all. You sleep while you watch it. It took me about a month to get through the whole entire movie. That is very sad considering the praise this movie received. I pray no one else ever has to go through the torture of watching this horrid movie.
An enduring piece of art that will change certain aspects of the way you think for the rest of your life. That's all.
Well what can I say but, Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. Powerful, poignant, thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting. The Shawshank Redemption works not only as an excellent prison drama, but as a metaphor for overcoming our own private prisons.An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! I have not read Stephen King's novella (his first non-horror), but some of the movie's deficiencies, such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message about camaraderie and redemption--must have been in the source material.
In this movie a man is mistakenly accused in murdering his wife and her boyfriend. He ends up finding away to keep himself occupy and finally helps out his new found friend.

I really like this movie, because it does show you that the system can make a mistake just like everyone can. All people make mistakes and since the government is run by humans of course there are going to be flaws. I had watched this movie for the first time with my dad and I loved watching it since. It does show that when you are determined you can do anything you put your mind to.

I think anyone who likes movies about prison or even about the judicial system will love this film.

This film should barely scratch out a spot in the top 250, let alone be one of the top ranked films of all time. It is rather dull, extraordinarily predictable, and filled with clichés. This is not even the best prison film, let alone #2 among all films! Cool Hand Luke or Papillon anyone? I'd give it a 7-8/10 (Freeman & Co. do not disappoint), but someone needs to bring down this bloated rating. The film is little more than a rehashing of conventional sentimentalism painted in prison stripes and sold in bulk to a (apparently) gullible audience. Help bring this down to a reasonable position so that more deserving films can attain their proper recognition.
all I can say about this is that it is by a clear mile one of the best films ever made! the story line was gripping and intriguing, there was never a single dull moment and i can honestly say that this film is definitely one that i can watch over and over again without being bored. the cast really brought the characters to life and it was just such an emotional roller-coaster. if you have never seen this film before then i definitely recommend that you watch it! watch it on your own or with friends and family it really doesn't matter because i can guarantee that everyone will love it and if they for some reason don't then they clearly have no taste
The shawshank redemption is probably the one of the best films ever depicted in cinematic form. It is the most controversial and sad film I've ever seen; second is American history x. I loved this film and I thought Tim Robbins was excellent and Morgan Freeman as well. Let me just say to that everybody should see this film. I give it 4/4

This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It's so Hollywood cliche ! How can this be in the top 2 best movies ever ? I don't understand it. Avoid at all cost, this movie is boring !
Shawshank truly is the best-made standalone movie of all time.

As much as I might like the extended Lord of the Rings trilogy more overall, as for singularly movies, nothing tops Shawshank.
I feel sorry for all of you , guys/girls who rated this as 1 star (awful). I really do not think you could consider this as the worst or one of the worst movies you have ever seen.

Maybe it is overrated, maybe not , but STOP trying to lower its position in the Top 250. This is supposed to be a USER RATING , so if you loved it , give it a 10 , if for you it is an average movie , give it a 5.

I read some comments about this one , and heard someone saying : " ... it is a good movie, deserves 6 or 7 stars , but i gave it 1 star because I think it is very overrated ... " That's so pathetic ...

Once again , STOP doing this and rate the movie as you liked it !
Absolutely mind-blowing movie. Great script, direction and acting!
it remained in the laptop movie folder for one and half year.............. every time i started to watch it i felt bored for the 1st 15 minutes....eventually i started to watch it more than 15 minutes for the first time............... then the miracle happened.....i just finished watching this phenomenon in one sitting with nearly grasping my breadth full with emotions ushering in my veins and artery.......just on sentence requires to describe it """It is worthy to be in the 1st place of the top 250 over 20 years and so On,.......if you haven't seen it see it.if you haven't listened to it hear it.if u haven't felt it yet feel it.


Without a doubt, one of the greatest films ever made, little to no continuity errors, fantastic acting and a thrilling and engaging story that keeps you hooked from start to end.
This movie was inspired by the brilliant Stir Crazy starring Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor. As an essay on prison life, Shawshank Redemption fails on every level that Stir Crazy managed to succeed on.

Shawshank is nowhere near as funny as Stir Crazy. There is not a woodpecker suited bank robbery to be found. There is no Grossberger, no homosexual black man hassling the heroes, no silly mania scenes. There is nothing here that even remotely comes close to emulating its predecessor.

The obvious links to the original are still there: Morgan Freeman in the Richard Pryor role and Tim Robbins as Gene Wilder. However, Robbins and Freeman are nowhere near Wilder and Pryor in the acting stakes and we end up feeling disappointed at their lack of conviction (no pun intended) in the roles.
Wonderful touching story that will make you cry AND feel extremely good inside. STEVEN KING proves that he is one of the best story writers EVER.

Superb acting by Freeman et al. Wonderful narrative, music, cinematorgraphy and backward looking story that escalates throughout the film.

A work of genious, J


There is nothing to criticize about this movie. It is made as subtle and touching a movie can be. It never goes into emotions more than necessary. The music, the story, the acting, everything is perfectly orchestrated. It is delicate and beautiful in all the sense of the term. It is such a shame that Morgan Freeman didn't got an award, it would have been well deserved. Stephen King wrote again a masterpiece, like the Green Mile, from the same author and the same film director. Frank Darabont execute this story more in a tone that reminds me "Out of Africa". The prison is a character by itself, all the actors including the secondary roles are just perfect. Watching this movie remains us the true meaning of hope, and that everything is possible.

But what are you doing here? Rather than reading reviews, just buy it, rent it and see it. It is one kind of a unique movie that you will never forget.
The first time I saw the movie I was crazy about it .I did not want to speak to anyone nor do anything .I wanted to rise my arms and cry ---yes, just like what Andy did .It really inspires me greatly .

I believe it is a terrific film because it includes all things a film should have. The plot , the characters,the director,the spirits are all top.So I want to see it for another time .

Then I find out that I don't like the oaks which stands for power and strength .Why can't the letter just between two brisks. It's obvious the director wanna tell us something in a obvious way. But it's not serious,this is quite personal. I still know what I can get from this movie. The more I see it ,the more I get .

I know Andy deserves the happy ending ,will he succeed in the real world?

The Shawshank Redemption will go down in history as one of the greatest movies of all time, If not the greatest movie ever.

The films draws you in for the very first second and keeps your eyes glued to the screen until the very last second! Excellently written and the acting was a class above the rest!! Highly recommend
An UNDER-RATED movie?? Gimme a break! This is one of the most over-rated movies on IMDB! 8.7, what a joke! This movie is boring, plain and simple. You want to watch a movie 5 times so that you can put the pieces together and finally get it, fine. I'd rather watch a movie that was actually more entertaining than a jigsaw puzzle.
If someone tells me to describe a real, entertaining movie - that would be it. 'Real' for the lack of SFX is a true bless when talking about "The Shawshank Redemption". I become fed up with pictures that achieve success based on the splendid job of the SFX crew or the team responsible for the CGI effects. Film's purity emphasises the importance of the act. The actors are incredible; not a single minute could be considered a bad acting (well, at least I think so). 'Entertaining' for it makes you enjoy the time spend on it and once finished there are no regrets. I am not a huge fan of Tim Robbins but the movie undoubtedly showed his talent. Mr. Freeman stays solid as usual in his act.
Amazing, must watch for everyone! Simple but touching.

This movie is a life changer. It can change the way of how you perceive the life one lives in this world. It really is a movie which helps you for redemption. It always provides motivation and hope no matter how many time i watch it. It really deserves it's first place in imdb.



Well pure plain movie. Boring Dull No story at all. Plz I request all to rate 1 🌟 to movie so others don't waste their time by influence by wrong rating.
When I watched this movie for the first time I knew anything about the movie, but I had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, I saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor.
When I watched this movie for the first time I didn't really know anything about the movie, but I had heard that it is pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, I saw it.

Thrill that I have experienced in the end doesn't match with any of the actions films that I have ever watched in my entire life.
One of the best prison movie ever made. I can't imagine talking about movies without mentioning this film.
This is the definition of a what a Great movie supposed to be like!
Proof, along with _Delores Claiborne_ and _Stand by Me_ that Stephen King can spin a fine tale when he sets his mind to it. Even having read the book (this is one case where the movie is better), Robbins and Freeman's performances were so captivating that the ending still took me by surprise. Definitely one of the best.



In this movie Morgan Freeman has delivered his greatest performance in his legendary career. Awesome right? but that's not all.

Shawshank Redemption is without doubt the best movie of its decade and one of the best movies ever made. Killer plot, great directing, great cinematography, amazing acting and in the end you are left stunned, touched and you will fall in love with it. If you do not like this movie something is definitely wrong with you.

This movie not winning any Oscar is simply disgraceful.

In conclusion if you haven't watched this movie than you are missing a lot.
Steven spielberg never ceases to amaze with his movies
I cannot believe that this movie has rec'd the accolades it has. I thought was mediocre at best and at worst saccharin, predictable, neatly cathartic and only mildly believable. I think that if it didn't contain the rape scenes, it would have been so sweet that I would have turned it off before I regurgitated. This is not to say that I enjoyed those scenes - I didn't - but it appeared that it was Frank Darabont's sophomoric attempt at instilling some sense of prison reality into an otherwise boring story about male bounding. I personally would not recommend this movie to anyone.
I always heard that this movie was good, so I decided to check it out. And I gotta say, I was quite impressed. The tone, characterization, screenplay, etc. are all fantastic. Is it the best movie of all time? Tough call. But it is one of the few movies I can say is 10/10 stars.
Truly a masterpiece of cinema. This is definitely one of my favorite movies.
what an amazing and motivating movie never get bored at any part of it. the music is so amazing and have you in a great movie mode. the screenplay was perfect you can never be bored from it or feel that any part wasn't in its place. Morgan freeman as great as usual never get bored from him knows when to make you laugh and when to get shocked or excited. also Tim Robbins I can't forget him since I first watched his movie Nothing to Lose with Martin Lawrence and the great amount of laughing and sorry you feel with along the movie. this movie for me is one of the iconic movies over history which I have a good memories for it and loves it so much.
The best movie I saw everrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrr rrrrrr rrrrrrr rrrrrrrr rrrrrr
Shawshank is supposed to be the greatest movie ever. It was alright to me.

I mean not much to say really. I've seen it too many times. I guess it's cool if it's your first time watching.

Not bad, worth watching

7 stars
Well directed & written. Each character is well played!

Directing, script is awesome, acting perfect. Film rocks forever
Haven seen movies that actually are a 10 - this is an almost 7. Eye-rolling bad acting by Robbins and the black guy (does he ever blink..?) - but the warden was very good. It took a long time to force myself to watch it, and I'm glad I did, but I would *never* sit thru this thing twice. Omg no.
This movie gives you unique feelings about you and your surroundings
Great film. If you like this, you'll love Virgins of Sherwood Forrest
Emotion, hope and justice all blend perfectly in this film. Quite simply, no other film comes close to this one in regards to screenplay, casting and plot development. No spoilers here - just a comment on a movie that can still move you to tears even after multiple viewings. Morgan Freeman delivers the performance of a lifetime. Everything else comes together in perfect harmony. This movie came out the same year as Forrest Gump which won the Oscar for best picture - Forrest Gump is a great picture but this one really deserved the "cake". Tim Robbins is AMAZING as Andy, and he supported brilliantly by a cast that one could only hope to see assembled again. This is one of those rare occasions where the movie actually surpasses the book for drama, suspense and flow. If you haven't seen this film, please do yourself the favour and watch it. I know you will not be disappointed!

"Get busy livin'"
This movie became my favorite movie of all time, before i had even seen the whole thing. Has this happened to anyone else? I had seen parts on TV and that was it. The day i finally rented it, i was practically jittery with excitement. This just tells you about my unique subjective experience with it. After it was over, I wasn't dissatisfied in the least. It is truly a great film all around. It is one of those things where part of me wants everyone in the world to see it, but another part of me feels like my personal experience with it makes it my own. I don't want to write an extensive review and put it under some kind of lens and analyze it. I'll just say that from that day forward, The Shawshank Redemption had profoundly affected the way I view movies and it his been the gateway into my current passion for films.

I have seen this movie and think it is very good, Tim Robbins is really good in it and Morgan Freeman as usual is great. It has a lot of original ideas and is deserving of much praise, however i really feel it lacks something that The Godfathers 1 and 2 have. They are just a different caliber of movie no offense to it, its very good. However Al Pacino in both of those films is as close to perfect of a performance as you will ever get. I really feel because it is 35 years old so many people of todays generation has not seen it, I am 20 and own all three and can appreciate the talent by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in the first film and Al in the second with Francis Ford Coppola directing both. I understand that when someone sees a movie and they would like to rate it on this site its difficult to see all the other movies on the top 250, but when you are dealing with the top 5 its not that hard, see those movies and then judge.
i remember watching this years ago, i loved the setting of the scenes and to me it was pretty good acting. and if anyone is to go see a good movie, i highly recommend this one, with some people it may not be their cup of tea, but, if you want a good kickback with some popcorn and prop your feet up, and take the phone off the hook, and DO NOT ANSWER THE DOOR, DESPITE THE NEIGHBORS WANTING A OCCASIONAL CUP OF SUGAR, than yes, this is good movie to sit back and enjoy.
It is really a nice movie I have seen. In beginning it seems some boring but after one hour it change the atmosphere. It is well planned and seen are thriller. I never seen such a beautiful movie. The role which actor has played is memorable and very energetic. I recommend to see it all the movie likers. Must watch movie.
The Shawshank Redemption movie love it . 😊😊😊............................................. ........................................................................................
I really liked the movie I'm delighted with it.I thought about this movie
Shawshank Redemption is a good movie with great actors, a decent director, wonderful music and a very obvious plot. I think the movie would have been between mediocre and failure were it not for Robbins and Freedman.

Its ranking on the IMDb top 250 is a shame. It shouldn't be on a list with other such high caliber films as the Godfather and Gone With the Wind. I think that the re-release of the DVD is the cause of its illogical high-standing.

Don't get me wrong. Its a good movie its just not as good as people say. Worth watching especially if your a fan of either of the main actors.

7 out of 10



This Movie is the most amazing in the industry's history . The best in the way it shows sequence of the events . Morgan Freeman Played a remarkable role in the movie .... movie has the successful mix ever made of emotions anger , peace , mystery , hate , love , Betrayal and friendship ... this movie will always be milestone in the history of film industry .... View and full interaction figures and the absolute harmony between the team of the film clearly reflected in the article submissions .... The imposition of the spirit of the prison and the transfer of the wonderful scenes that way like a prisoner until the end of the film when liberated liberally of movie's main characters essence of success was felt throughout the film that he is no life outside the walls, but in some scenes .... it's a perfect work by the standards of the industry ....
Few movies allow you to feel as though youve been put on a riverboat in the middle of july as the suns going down, where you can see just how good you've really got life on the land.

The movie is simply a symphony of finely tuned instruments allowing you to feel the pluck of every characters heart strings as they wash through their own version of corrections.

Great movie!
I happened to watch this movie after taking a look at its ratings, I was like let's see what's all the hype about. After 142 minutes my jaw dropped and I said to myself "This is the best goddamn movie I've ever seen in my life.". This movie gives meaning to life by being a legitimate feel-good movie. "HOPE IS A GOOD THING, MAYBE THE BEST OF THINGS, AND NO GOOD THING EVER DIES." the best dialogue ever written in any film ever produced. I was so into the film even I felt his redemption, I had a smile on my face by the end of the movie. Overall: The Best, The most satisfying, A pure feel-good film.
Although it does represent prison life in the 1940s and Robbins does a great job , this movie failed to entertain me. The movie is very well done, but the ending is silly and predictable. I don't understand the hype .
Nothing in the history of the entertainment industry compares to this films wonderful, inspiring and completely unforgettable ending. The title of the film is the on criticism you could make of this masterpiece. If you talk to any group of people about "what's the best film ever made" you're almost guaranteed that someone in the group will mention this film.

The script is superb and both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins really do make it a moving story of friendship, dignity, and most importantly hope. It's one of those films where you feel obliged to recommend it to everyone you know. Theirs something so special about this film and you shouldn't be allowed to talk about films if you've missed this gem.
Shawshank Redemption, based on a short story by Stephen King, is about a man named Andy who is sent to jail after being convicted of killing his wife and lover He adapts to jail and is planning something big - all through the film, clues are given as to what he is doing as he takes advantage of certain privileges he has.

He makes friends with people in jail, and goes through his daily life. Hope is all he can hold on to, count on, and rely on. Through years he figures a way to end all of it. The story fallows himself and friends as they try to rid themselves of an underlying feeling - a feeling of always being trapped. They hated the walls of the jail. They've grown used to them. And they love them. But not Andy.

Everything about this movie is amazing. Screenplay, cinematography,acting, production... its simply one of the best films off all time.
According to me "Shawshank Redemption" is very bad name. It is ver complex. People can forget this name easily.
Okay based on what is the greatest movie of all time. It didn't win best picture that year. None of the actors won an Oscar! Besides I have never seen a human who doesn't get old over so many years. I am sorry but I think bragging about this movie ruined its beauty.

Defiantly not a top 10 movie of all time.
No, this is NOT the greatest film of all time. I don't think you could pinpoint one single film as that but "The Shawshank Redemption" is one of the most powerful and moving experiences of the 1990's (other masterpieces include "Schindler's List", "Dead Man Walking", "The Piano", "Glengarry Glen Ross", etc.) "The Shawshank Redemption" is the harrowing story of a man wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to prison to serve two life sentences. There he meets Red, who becomes his best friend. The film speaks loudly about hope and its unending importance in life and that is a lesson we too often forget. This film is a marvelous reminder, with remarkable performances by Tim Robbins and Oscar-nominated Morgan Freeman. It is beautifully written and expertly directed and a fine film in several aspects.

Regardless of whether it IS the greatest film of all time, the greatest film of the decade, or the greatest film of 1994, it is not to be missed for it holds wisdom and is great fun.
This film is a masterpiece. It manages to wrench the viewer through every emotion possible. With Morgan Freeman's ardent narration and Tim Robbins' masterful expressions, Director Frank Darabont has taken a short description by Stephen King and crafted it into something that deserves to be seen by everyone.

This is the greatest film ever made. Everyone already knows that. (If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on one of the greatest experiences you will ever have). I could write for hours about the masterful direction, the acting which challenged perfection, the incredible writing, etc., but I wanted to point something out that others seemed to have missed. This film boasts the best music I have ever heard in a film. Whoever wrote the music deserves the credit of being the man, in my opinion, who made this film what it is. I'm actually studying music as my major in college, with film as my minor. So I just wanted to tell everyone to notice the music next time you watch this film, and you will have a much more enjoyable experience. Every person who contributed to this film is brilliant and I worship everyone who had anything to do with this film.
Thought to be one of the greatest movies of all time and ranked 2nd on IMDb's list of top 250 movies ever created. When i first heard of this film and its general plot i wasn't too enthusiastic about watching it. I mean, lets get serious... yet another prison movie where someone is supposedly wrongly accused for a crime he did not commit... we've seen them all. However, i can honestly and proudly admit that i was beyond the shadow of a doubt, completely and utterly wrong. This is truly an amazing movie. With its own charisma to it, it leaves the audience on the edge of their seats, wanting to find out more and waiting for the plot to unravel further. It captures your mind and truly speaks to you. Of course, a great deal of respect must be given to Morgan Freeman and Tim Robin for their outstanding performances. This movie deserves to have its own genre. A MUST see movie and a personal favorite.
This is that type of movie i can recommend to any body irrespective of their likes dislikes the bestest of the best hollywoood has produced till now period the cast is good the acting is good the direction is good the pace of the movie is on point and the message they want to convey is loud and clear that is NEVER LOOSE HOPE tim robbim ans morgan freeman acting and the way they convey the story make this movie even more engaging so i will give this movie a strong 9/10 stars thanks
Days passes, locked behind the doors.Hopes blinking throughout. Fear of consciousness. Shawshank Redemption will be iconic for the entire society.
In my opinion the greatest film of all time. Acting - perfect. Pacing - perfect. Plot - perfect. Definitely a must watch for anyone.


It's the best film I've ever seen. It was truly an amazing film, it should be seen alone, and watched without a phone in hand.
In my opinion, it deserves to be in AFI's top 10 of all time. Just one of those extremely rare movie experiences. The highest compliment I can pay it is that every movie I have watched since Shawshank has paled in comparison. I've never been so involved in a movie from beginning to end. And the ending is so incredible it provides inner joy you can't even express. Gump was very good and won Oscars because of the hype and $$$ it spent & collected. But, Shawshank with no special effects or high priced productions provided better script, plot development, acting and ending than 99.9% of Hollywood films before and probably after it. Totally under-appreciated masterpiece..
Great!! good movie.......................................
It's not that the storyline is extremely complex or something which makes this film great. The characters and the acting is what makes this film extraoridinary. So this film is about a few fellas who are prisoners inside the prison. Their goal is to get free. The characters live on hope and that's why this film is so important, it's one of the best inspirational movies ever which shows that no matter how bad the situation is, you will still have always have hope. The ending of this film is pure work of art and beauty. Hell, the whole film is one of the best cinematic experiences ever.
The Cost of Bondage tells the stories of the world that two prisoners, Andy and Red, set up behind bars. Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker. He is tried for the murder of his wife and his lover and is sentenced to life imprisonment. Shawsank Prison beatings, torture, rape, all kinds of situations are happening, but Andy is committed to life and optimistic. This attitude shows the people around him. When Andy opens his hopeful perspective, he convinces all prisoners that your bars are a bile-free life. Andy will also have a friend who will partner with these bubbles: Red. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, an adaptation of Stephen King, starring the film. In 1995, the film was nominated for seven Oscar nominations, including the best film nomination
An amazing tale to explain such a simple message. Be patient, work hard, work smart and what was looking impossible will make it possible by itself.

I've heard of this movie before i saw it, to be honest not a single disagree on the perfectness of the actors or the production or the story or the dialogue, man!!! when i saw it i agreed and supported it to the last very minute, its one of the best movies i ever watched and it really deserve to the 1st top movie in the American cinema's history ... I'd like to thank all the people who worked in or share in it, i give it up for their great effort that will last in every one's memory for his life time. I'm sorry for my weak expression as I am impressed and my words may fail me, I did my best to deliver what i think. Hope to see new production with this kind of quality and this kind of mastering in every single detail.
The greatest movie ever made..! Period. Pure and simple, it is what every director hope to achieve. The film will keep you glued to your seat if you know what it means.It will bring tears to your eyes. It will make you think how you have lived your life so far...or in fact how you have wasted it. It will teach you the value of freedom which we enjoy without giving a second thought. And it will leave you with a sense of happiness which you will experience only rarely. The performances are simply mind boggling, be it Tim Robbins or Morgan Freeman or countless others. And it is difficult to believe this was the debut of Frank Darabont as a director.If you haven't already seen it... please do, otherwise you are missing something.

The first time I saw "The Shawshank Redemption" I was only 12. At the time I was amazed at how a movie could present so much emotion. As I have grown, my taste in movies has also. Still, I rank "Shawshank" as my favorite film, the one that I could watch every day for the rest of my life. If you have not seen this film, I pity you. Do not just rent it at your local Blockbuster. I implore you step away from your computer, go out to the nearest store, and buy this movie. Not only do Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give performances that will make you question your humanity, but you will most definitely learn something that will benefit you as a person. So, if you are yet to see this film, you must (in the words of Andy), "Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'."
One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.

He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people "will" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.
The greatest movie ever made..! Period. Pure and simple, it is what every director hope to achieve. The film will keep you glued to your seat if you know what it means.It will bring tears to your eyes. It will make you think how you have lived your life so far...or in fact how you have wasted it.

It is a masterpiece,you can watch it one time,in middle you may feel that it is loosing but overall it is a good film
Me encanto la historia la recomiendo ver, cuenta una gran historia
This movie deserves to be the best.. No movie made till the date has beaten it
I would recommend this movie to everyone. The acting, directing, cinematography are all top notch. The cast are so good that its hard to imagine anyone else in those roles. If this movie does not make you laugh and then at, the very least, make you cry a little bit, then you have no soul.

The greatest movie never to have won an academy award - no doubt. The greatest movie of all time - possibly

If you have never seen this movie you are lucky, because i will never again be able to see it for the first time.A truly heart-warming and inspiring piece of cinema. Awesome
awesome movie...the story is highlight and the way Tim Robbins acted is simply superb...one of my favorite movies...!!! I really loved all the characters of the movie and all the drama involved in it. this is one movie that took over my mind for many days. It created a stir worldwide and made me think that movie's can be made in this way also.so I suggest movie lovers to watch this movie and not to miss a single scene in this film.hats-off to the cast and crew of shaw shank redemption it is one hell of a movie which will be remembered at least for a century.lets hope we get to see more films like these and enjoy the drama and enthusiasm which was provided by this very film.
There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again. I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement.
I felt very emotional with the story during my teenage. When I rewatched in my 20s, I understood the brilliant script and storytelling of the movie.

During my 30s, I am totally addicted to epic nuances of the movie and hidden gems. I have no idea what I might find out in my 40s or 50s!
This is simply the best film ever made. It just goes to show that you don't need mutli-million pound special effects, and a number one theme tune to make a good film.
Where do I begin. This movie has everything. An exciting and interesting plot. Even more interesting characters. An amazing story from beginning to end. One that anyone can recognize and enjoy. I watch this movie once a year during the Christmas holidays and every year it gets better. I can state without shadow of doubt that Shawshank redemption is my all time favorite movie. I might add also that I consider it the greatest movie ever made.
This movie is flawless in my opinion. Every situation and character are so intricately woven, there is no wasted celluloid here. Every aspect of the movie, from acting, directing, and all factors that make up a masterpiece are in top form. It is truly a testament to the spirit of man and how each one of us handles what life throws at us in our own way. If you are feeling down, give it a watch and it's hard not to be inspired. I find more meaning with each viewing. It's one of the few movies that I've not grown tired of watching again and again. Once again, in my opinion, it's one of the best!
The first time I saw this movie I loved it. But I loved it more and more every time I saw it again. If you want to have a good and entertaining time watching a movie, buy this movie.
One of the nicest films ever and immortal in memory
It's amazing how long I could not watch this movie. However, I became interested in them only after reading the book. And the book is very good. However, the same can be said about the film. Yes, there are some nuances ...
i'm sorry for watching this great film by a pirate video cd, that's the only way i can approach movies like this, because i live in china. in this place, you can only see a hollywood movie like "true lie" those having radical actions in it. i watched this movie when all my family were sleeping, for none of them likes this movie, they have no patience to continue watching movie like this with no action. and i really touched, in some extents living in china is somewhat like living in shawshank, you need hope and endurance to keep on, i got a lot from this movie, thanks to the director to tim robbins and morgan freeman,and the vendor who recommend the video cd to me.
One interesting thing about this movie is how quickly it seems to pass. The movie could have continued this story for another 2 or 3 hours and I don't think it would have lost my interest. I think just because normal people like this movie is no reason to lower its rating with the 'movie critics'. The best movie ever??? Definitely. Everything else pales in comparison.
This film is amazing! It holds such emotional power. There is such meaning in it, and it is all captured beautifully in this movie. The fact that hope does in fact still exist! Tim Robbins, and Morgan Freeman are an amazing team in it. I loved it! Its one every movie lover, or just anyone should see!

This film was good, don't get me wrong, but in a million years it would never have occurred to me that this film would rank # 1 in the Internet Movie Database's top 250 films [ I hope this doesn't last - it's april 1999]. It is ridiculous. It is a good story, has good acting/character development, medium cinematography/music/everything else etc.....

As enjoyable as any other half decent film - but not number one in MY top 250 - probably not even in my top 250.
The GMOAT?????? LMAO Prison dramas are a dime a dozen what makes this different from any other prison drama?

It is unoriginal and cliched.

And I dont like Stephen King.

He wrote a horrible little story called IT.
One of the best films I´ve ever seen. In the end I cried like a baby. Don´t miss this excellent movie.
A wonderful film, truly one of the best ever made and deserving of its place among the top films. There may be problems but the clever story line and brilliant actors will distract you from that. Tim Robbins has a good role as Andy Dufresne, the banker convicted for the murder of his wife and her Lover. Morgan Freeman has an absolutely brilliant role with his portrayal of Red, the experienced prison Fixer, in an example of excellent casting. The film shows the corruption within the prison system and has excellent characterisation. The idea of leaving prison is questioned throughout the film, as the characters wonder how beneficial leaving prison will really be. The film is certainly quite violent but the storyline more then makes up for this. The ending is delightful to watch but I won't spoil it. You should watch the film yourself.
This is the best movie of all time. It has a great cast in Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. This is the greatest movie based of a book I have ever seen. Every character filled every role to the best they could and they all did great. When you first watch this movie you think the story is about Tim Robbins character but when you watch it a second time you actually see that its a story about Morgan Freeman. I love this movie and always will. Watch this movie its the best there ever was. Also Tim Robbins should have won an Oscar for his performance in this movie. I give this movie ****/****. This truly is the best movie of all time, it is definitely better than The godfather.
This story truly is an emotional piece of art and show's a lifelike drama of a mid 20th centrury American prisoner and his friend's along with the struggles of injustice . It made me cry in the ending. This is a masterpiece on all levels .
Wow! This is a great film, one which surpasses anything I or anyone else could ever say about it. Truly one of the best films ever.

Like a beautifully crafted French wine, this movie keeps getting better and better with every passing year. Every time I have viewed it over the past decade (and it must be at least more than 20 times by now), I have found newer shades, subtler indications, and deeper meanings. And it has amazed me like very few have.

* No overacting * Humour in the drab hopeless environs of Shawshank * Method in the madness of running the scams from inside * The complete secrecy maintained for 20 years (not even Red knew!) * The best that a highly-educated intellectual could do inside such a prison * What a great actor the Warden turned out to be - totally despicable! * What a bunch of speakable quotes.. what a bunch! * Totally recommended for any young person - students especially * HOPE TRULY IS THE BEST OF THINGS - a message that shines through
I love this film but it has simply been blown out of proportions.
The acting is top-notch, the dialogue is superb, and even the cinematography only serves to highlight the first two. This movie never fails to bring a tear to my eye. The tears start about 10 minutes before the ending in anticipation. I've never used this word to describe a movie before, but it is beautiful.
What is this movie is doing in the top ten? Its a good movie. By good I mean - you go to see it and you walk out saying - that was a good movie. Then you may watch it again because you remember enjoying it the first time. On the third viewing you are beginning to tire of it and the characters seem more contrived and you begin to see how the script has some flaws. Still - all and all - its better than most. A great movie (and there are many) is a movie that no matter how many times you watch it you marvel at the script - the performances - the music - all the things we love about the movies. The Shawshank Redemption doesn't come close. Well made, good performances, but not great and not deserving of being on ANY top ten movie list of all time.
A masterpiece. No other words has to be said. A pure original masterpiece.
This movie is simply the greatest. Anybody can relate to the message of hope and the importance of freedom. If this movie can't inspire you to live your life to the fullest, I don't know what will. And I think all fans of this film will agree that the ending of this movie is the greatest. I must have breathed only three times while watching that. And critics complain that it's long. All the great movies are though. Anyway, whoever reads these comments and hasn't seen the film yet, go rent it. You will not regret it.

Exceptional - Directing/ Exceptional- Screen play/ Exceptional - Writting/ Exceptional - Cinematography/ Exceptional - Acting/ Exceptional - Plot/ Exceptional - Characters/ Exceptional - production Design/ Exceptional - Sound.

Though I really enjoyed this movie, never would I agree that it is best film ever. It's powerful and full of heart, but it lacks one thing which is extremely important in a good film: originality. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were excellent in this film but their relationship is much like the relationship between Clint Eastwood and the librarian in "Escape From Alcatraz." The involvement of the library, the old coon who dies (Doc), the brut who is a threat (Wolf), the hole, the oppressive warden, and the escape in general all come from "Escape From Alcatraz." Though "Escape From Alcatraz" is not as powerful and emotional as "The Shawshank Redemption," it is a brilliantly done film and has the originality which "Shawshank" lacks. Though I do not want to belittle those who worship "Shawshank," I would suggest that anyone who has seen it should rent "Escape From Alcatraz." Then you may think twice before calling "Shawshank" the greatest film ever.

'The Shawshank Redemption' is perhaps one of, if not the, perfect film. Every other "great film", or any film for that matter has it's pros and cons. Most motion pictures that are as well received as this have plenty going for it, very few against it. While I feel there are films out there with better pros; the pro to con ratio of 'The Shawshank Redemption' out-stands any other film film ever produced.

I can't begin to describe every amazing element of this film. Obviously the performances are exquisite, the directing is exceptional and the score is extraordinary. The cinematography, in particular, struck me. Roger Deakins is a master with light and framing.

I will watch this film again and again and remember it as one of the greatest films ever made. This film truly lies within the sweet spot of cinema.
Amazing Film. Very Good. Very Very Nice. The Shawshank Redemption(1994)
Amazing movie - great direction - professional actors - not overrated it deserve to be where it is. This movie comes is my all time favorite movie list.
A great film which makes you think abot the most important things in life
The problem with this movie is that it is to ordinary. It seems like the movie is just a cheap feelgood flick that has an ending that is easily predicted. I didn't care much for the characters and the narration was pretty annoying. I've read the book and it's a good adaptation. See it if your a Stephen King fan or like Dramas.
Best movie ever made. Based on a Stephen King short story. I've seen it at least 20 times. It never gets boring. It's just overwelming and sorrowful. It makes you sad, angry and happy at the same time. Never forget, there is hope. Believe in your dreams.
I thought Shawshank was a gorgeous movie, wonderfully shot with beautiful production design. That said, I have a hard time watching the film. It drags-on for too long. I think the filmmakers were aiming for deep-thought provoking pacing, but I just got bored. The film moves slowly just so you can see how beautiful it is; personally, pretty pictures are not enough for me.

The movie is the best prisons movies but i guess it needs a little more good writing
I am happy to know that I am not the only one who thinks this is one of the best movies of all time. It's my personal favorite. It shows the determination of a person to live his life. How he works for years on his escape tunnel. The subplot of the parallel life outside of prison of Brooks and Freeman's character is excellent. I don't think any part of the movie is bad, not even avarage. It's perfect from beginning to end. The only probable flaw I see in it is that it makes criminals look better than they actually are, but that's the point.
Many people may be imprisoned by their own cages! No light, no tomorrow, no hope! Maybe you will sink because of this, but also may break through it, defeat it, and finally win the self sublimation! This movie seems to tell us that! Every time I watch it, every time I feel touched, I can have a lot of hope!
There's not much to say about this masterpiece, it's spectacular in everything. Very entertaining and touching. This is a movie that you need to see before you die.
What an excellent movie!!! This has to be one of the best of all time. Morgan Freeman is excellent as always. Tim Robbins was superb. I've always believed Robbins was a decent actor, but he superceded any expectations I had. The movie is a real feel good movie. I recommend it for anyone over 15.
This movie was a great adaptation of a great novella. Unlike many other movies made from books, this movie captured was almost an exact match.

A great commentary on how a person's environment can make them do strange things. I think Andy said something like "I wasn't a criminal until I got to prison."

Great movie!
This is very awesome movie rtdfgcvtrfd t4efdgcvrtfd rrefd
The story's quite plain, the acting is OK but nothing really over the top, even though the soundtrack, the quality of the shots and the atmosphere really stood out! I think it's for obvious sentimental reasons that people like this movie! The good guy takes a lot of crap but wins in the end because he's smart!! There are way better movies than this one and I really can't understand why so many people rate it 10!! 10 equals perfection and very few pieces of art come close to it!! I think 7 is a very high rating and this movie probably doesn't deserve more than an 8 maximum!! The masses don't necessarily appreciate subtle art and want to be entertained, that's what the movie industry is about! Still, this movie was quite gay! Way too much emo and way to predictable!
This movie is jus the best of all time. Acting , directing , writing , ending, all of this in one movie.
Okay, i am obviously in the minority here, but i would not place this movie even among my top 100. Nevertheless, the Shawshank Redemption is a good movie and solid entertainment, filled with a compelling story, good actors and an accurate script. But i honestly can not see why this movie is appreciated so well; the cinematography is not that great and i have seen many more emotionally involving/uplifting movies as well, just think of The great dictator, The celebration (Festen), Leaving Las Vegas, etc.. 7/10
I don't know anyone who dislikes this film. It's an absolute classic every time you watch it 10/10!!
I'll keep it short and sweet. The cinematography along with the storyline, paired with the perfect cast make this one of my favorite movies of all time!
Best movie of all time for a reason, even after more than 20 years nothing have come close to it.
Was a great Movie !! I love the story and the actors were fantastic. There is so much to say about this movie. But look, seriously, look and say it is not a great movie from beginning to end. Of course a good soundtrack also makes a great movie, so the soundtrack also has to be mentioned. The Movie Picture is very good. good angles of shooting, always transmitting us the space inside the prison. or rather the space that we have not. And finally, check out this great movie. they repented and were left with a better perspective for life. See the movie, enjoy and learn! To finish just saying that it as a great movie, oh wait, i already said that, no problem its to highlight the idea.
As a younger viewer who wasnt born when the movie released, I can by heart say that movieproductions has gone downhill. Im not pointing out that all movies we produce today are bad, but that in 25 years of evolving in technology and having good actors, writers etc. No movies would stand a chance to being as good as this was. This movie shows the true art of directing and storytelling.

Its a kind of movie that got me thinking, learning and at the same time connect emotionally with the characters.

I pat myself on the back for going on IMDB and hitting the top rated movies of all time. If I didnt, I wouldnt have had the chance to view this masterpiece.
What a movie! It was probably my 2nd or 3rd Hollywood movie when I started watching movies. Morgan Freeman was exceptional in his character as always though Andy Dufresne could have done better. A simple yet mesmerizing plot, wonderful cinematography and a memorable climax. This movie packs everything a cinemagoer desires. What I love most about the movie though is the message it delivers. "HOPE". Hope is the thing that drives us forward, Hope that we can carve a better future for ourselves than our past, than our present. Without hope, there couldn't be a meaning to existence.
This movie is gold, i really liked and even more knowing is from the genious Stephen King... This movie has everything, we have mistery, suspense, drama, i really loved this film !!!
Oh come on 2nd best movie ever, I don't think so. It's unrealistic and overly sentimental, the people who voted so high can't have seen many films. By all means watch it, but Papillion for example, is far superior, who can forget Steve McQueen's red rimmed eyes and pasty face as he catches bugs, and crushes centipedes into his watery broth to get nourishment in that incredible portrayal of hardship and determination. I wouldn't put Papillion as the 2nd best film of all time, but it has to be the best Prison drama. Watch Shawshank and you'll enjoy it as a lightweight entertaining feel good movie, but there are so many classic films better than this.
If you like crime or prison films watch this. Has the highest film rating on IMDB (2020 February).
I could re-re-rewatch this every time. Must watch!
Based on the Stephen King's book. It made me think about a lot of things.
It's pretty obvious that this movie got to the top thanks to its publishing date (1994). IMDb became a viable site in 1994 and this was one of the best movies of that year. From there on - inertia. Why 6 out of 10? Cliché, Waaay tooo much. That's why IMDb should be ashamed of its algorith. Strike it down..

Very very weak. There is practically nothing in the entire film that surprises us in any way. If the purpose of the film was to be edifying, frankly, I saw nothing useful, neither moral nor spiritual. And it's not because I'm hard at heart; on the contrary, I have a good heart and high conservative moral values. But I finished watching this movie and I felt me depressed and upset by the waste of my time. In fact, I already got used to not giving credit to the high ratings of IMDb users.
Salvation in Shawshank begins with a mysterious and enigmatic atmosphere (the result of Frank Darabont's decoupage and perfect atmosphere) and the arrival of Andy Dufresne (a first-class banker accused of killing his wife) to the prison location. By creating a narrator and a relative change of perspective and throwing the burden of narration on the shoulders of the rejectionist (Morgan Freeman), he invites the audience to judge Doferrin and watch his character from a greater distance.

this an incredible film this movie was make feel the happiness this unbelievable 20years dug in the jail without no body know and abbreviation this is a great movie and this is form a few great movies you will see it in your life and is to be enough the writer was the greatest writer in the world Stephen king Tim Robinson give all he have in this film and Morgan free man he give unforgettable part in his Lief and how was believe the bad and strong officer at the end crying and they take him to punshid him above he did and Tim Robinson pushed the administrator of the jail to suicide after he take all his money this movie i will can't forget it for along time he will be in my memory for ever
It's not just a movie, it's hope, life, death and trying to survive.

Tim Robbins smirks his way through this cheap rip-off of the >"Count of Monte Cristo". The anti-Christian bigotry is too much >to stomach -- the murderous warden wears a cross, thumps a Bible >and utters fundamentalist platitudes. Morgan Freeman is very >solid tho
This movie is one of the best movies of all time. At first the title+the poster of this movie might seems boring and uninteresting. Once you start watching this movie, you cannot stop. This movie will inspire you to not give up in your life like what Andy Dufresne said "Get busy living or get busy dying".

This movie is the master piece of art. The flow of the story, the editing of each scenes, the acting of the actors, and everything else in this movie are perfectly combined together. Shanwshank Redemption is a must-see movie.
It's the best movie I've ever seen in my life. Without a doubt, this movie along with Gladiator are the best in history.
Nice film i cant speak english but nice, yes nice the best
I've read the novella from "Different Seasons," and feel that Frank Darabont's screenplay was an excellent refinement of King's story. It pretty much sticks with the original plot while eliminating some portions which didn't add much to the story as a whole. The only part I wish they would have included (that they didn't) was Red's tales of other breaks at Shawshank Prison, if only for the novelty of them. Regarding the movie alone, I thought the grand aerial views of the prison combined with Thomas Newman's score (especially the 'Stoic Theme') were quite wonderful, almost breathtaking in their scope and power. I would have to say this is by far Tim Robbins' best role to date while it at least is among Morgan Freeman's top three cinematic performances. I have seen this movie several times, and although I'd say the first viewing is the best, I never tire of experiencing the story of Andy and Red, their story of hope.
I have no idea why this rates so highly. The whole premise is completely unrealistic. Its an OK prison film, but even Escape from Alcatraz is much better.
This is certainly a good movie, with universal themes of freedom and adversity etc etc, but... I've seen plenty of movies which were more artfully made than this one. There is nothing revolutionary in the directing. The novella by Stephen King is practically tailor-made for a movie adaption, and it seems any capable director could have made a good movie from it. I think the only reason this movie is #2 on this list is the sheer amount of people who have seen it and voted. The other truly great movies near the top of the list don't pack the same mass audience appeal that Shawshank Redemption does, nor are they shown on TNT 6-10 times a year. Movies like 2001, The Seven Samurai, or Lawrence of Arabia, for example, would bore many of the people who love Shawshank Redemption, and I personally consider those three I named and many others to be far better creations than the Shawshank Redemption. Perhaps we should take a poll of TNT viewers on the best movie of all time - I'd bet Shawshank Redemption would place first, with The Blues Brothers coming in a close second.
The movie is about an accountant who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover and as a result is sentenced for a life in prison. The movie is filled with deep meanings but unfortunately it is very boring and directed in a very lame way. Plus the musical score is preety bad and does not spark any emotions from you. In this type of movie an emotional and memorable musical score is very important but somehow the filmmakers did not seem to care.
Great movie. One of my favourite movie of all time. A prisoner life is shown as the movie . Especially we also experience that .


It's a fantastic film based of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. I adore this film, truly. Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Frank Darabont as a director. What's not to love? Maybe not THE BEST film ever, but it's up there.

The novella is very good, if a little sentimental. The film is a masterpiece, though, that I actually prefer to the source material. Anyways, it's a must watch. Timeless.
I simply do not know how some people out there voted this movie anything less than a 6 or 7, but a small percentage had the audacity to vote it a "ONE"! There are always that small percentage. Sometimes I believe people vote down other movies in some attempt to get THEIR favorite movie into a certain spot. The fact that people put that much effort into doing so amazes me. I'll take the time to comment on a movie and give my 2 cents worth of opinion. This movie was a classic the day it premiered and the 2nd place showing overall demonstrates that without fault. My hope is those who voted it down somehow obtain a clue.

The Shawshank Redemption is amazingly powerful story about two friends life in prison. The characters Andy and Red are fundamentally good men in a hostile environment. This is a quietly narrated movie, by Red (Morgan Freeman) and gives an up close, raw depiction of lives served in prison and the ongoing trials of several inmates. This film is a compelling story of redemption.

This is an excellent movie, whether it is direction, or cinematography or editing, each and every frame looks brilliant. In fact it is a trendsetting film and I would like to watch it again and again. And last but not the least the background score is also awesome. The background music and the story are weaved together in such a way that it doesn't look that these are two different things. It's like they are made for each other. Each and every character of the movie has given an unforgettable performance and I appreciate each and every technicians' and artistes' hard work which they have put into this movie.

A classic movie that you can watch over and over again. Brilliant performances by all actors and actresses.
Best movie ever, I enjoyed it a lot. The Shawshank Redemption received positive reviews on its release, particularly for its story and the performances of Robbins and Freeman, it was a box-office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from films such as Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, to the general unpopularity of prison films, lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered to be confusing for audiences. It went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven Academy Award nominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased the film's box-office gross to $58.3 million.
I should have watched this one many many years ago, when I heard of it for the first time. This movie is amazing!
This film is based on one of my favourite Stephen King novels (albeit a 'novella') The original book contained four long 'short stories' one which became 'Stand By Me' (another great movie) and 'Rita Heyworth & The Shawshank Redemption' which has been (full marks to the director& production team)lovingly rendered into a true cinematic masterpiece. Staying true to the printed word, it follows the prison life of Andy Dupree from sentence to freedom with care and sympathy, never revelling in his hardships or flouting his attempts at beating the system. The film concentrates on his will to survive and his hope for eventual freedom. Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman were born to play their respective parts in this film. If neither had ever made another film, it would not matter because this film will always be their mark in movie history. No major action sequences, no breathtaking special effects and no outrageous subject matter. Just a great movie, based on a great story, acted convincingly with great skill by two men who could really be the best of friends the story requires them to be. Superb.
this is one of the greatest movies ever made. I have watched this movie over two dozen times. I never tire of seeing "Andy Get Them". the lack of awards that this movie recieve was a true travesty. Tim Robbins performance ranks as quite possibly his best and considering who we are talking about that is saying alot. Morgan Freeman talent overshadow the fact that he was not like his character in the book. The rest of the cast though for the most part nameless is extraordinary. Chief among them though is Ron Perlman. There cant be anyone who didnt feel a great swell of joy when they heard the chess piece go through the poster. This is one of the greatest cinema moments i have ever witnessed. This film taps into you and elicts a great emotion. This is something few movies have or ever will do, but it is what makes this one of the greatest films ever made.
One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.
IT WAS AMAZING AND WONDERFUL BUT I WANT WATCH AGAIN
I have seen this film so many times over the years and each time I watch it, I find something new. It's a film that takes me through a ride of emotions from tears of sadness to tears of happiness. It's a tale of hardship and friendship. The casting and dynamic of the actors is first class. This will always be my favourite Movie.
Saw this movie after seeing imdb top rated movies and doubted what s wrong with those people who consider this movie as a masterpiece. the movie is so plain i understand it is a old movie and a feel good one but keeping it number 1 above pulp fiction or prestige movies does nt make any sense

Shawshank is nothing more than a fairy tale. It tells us as much about what prison is really like as Pretty Woman tells us about what prostitution is really like. People like fairy tales, so both these movies were very popular.
Hands down one of the best movies i've ever seen. I was glued to the screen for the entirety of this film and invested fully in to the story within. Amazing.
I saw this movie about a year ago and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. Everything about this movie is so perfect and if I'd have to choose one favourite scene it'd have to be the scene where Andy and Red enjoys a beer on the rooftop, Even though this movie is a bit old I still didn't think about it at all while watching it.

I ussually don't give movies such high reviews but this one definetly deserves a 10 out of 10!
On of my all time favorite movies. Its a great story line with great talent.
Frank Darabont is no Orsen Welles. This is a manipulative piece of garbage which has successfully fooled many people.

DONT BE A SHEEP !! THIS IS A CRAPPY MOVIE ! PERIOD !!!
Not a spoiler but a ? Well the whole movie was compelling but noted something forgotten how good it was when i first saw it 25 years ago but perhaps a missed fact or? Well when they couldn't find the gun thrown in the river to identify and compare to crime scene, yet they found bullets and broken glass where his car was, wouldn't those bullets at his car be different from the ones at the crime scene ....would have proved his story but other than than, unless he was deliberately framed by someone but it doesn't even touch on that...


Too slow. Concept is not as good. Below average movie. I am not able to force myself to watch again.
It was shocking to know initially that this masterpiece was not accepted by audience when it was released.Well it was too ahead of it's time.It shows real character development of Red...a unwise hothead kid to a wise man who accepted his wrong doing.What I like the most was its ability to tell an extraordinary story in a very pleasant and simple appealing way.I like the simplicity of the storytelling process.Its a masterpiece no doubt in it.Its a great story.
When I signed up for the IMDB they ask you what your favourite movie is? Shawshank rose to the top of my mind immediately. This film brought hope and inspiration to most hopeless and soul robbing of environments. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are fantastic! Does Steven King have more stories like this one?

One of the best films I've ever seen is a masterpiece.
A great movie about both good and horrible people

Who can say they watched this and did not become immersed? Everything about this movie is askew, as it gives enormous insight into our lives, the system and negative reinforcement. There are some wonderfully cathartic moments, as well in this surreal story about a man betrayed by a skank of a wife and a system that rewards profit and power over the truth. Yet, he knows much, and what he knows has been fed diligently to the same powers that oppresses them. With a very carefully thought out plot that takes the time to flesh out each character, and actors equal to the task, The pigs are disgusting and the bible thumping freak such a menace. I would hope this incredibly original film is watched by even more people.
Well what else can I say about a Masterpiece! 10/10

No words needed to describe this movie everything is composed really beautifull just watch
